# Chapter overview

In this chapter we will learn how to:

 - Construct and perform a hypothesis test
 - Construct a confidence interval

# Basic inference procedures 

## Hypothesis tests 

### The null and alternative hypotheses

### The test statistic

### The distribution under the null hypothesis

## Confidence intervals 

## Inference for the probability of an event

## Inference for the mean of a normal random sample

# Extensions

## One-tailed tests 

## Testing a single linear restriction 

## Testing multiple linear restrictions

## Asymptotic tests
