## Course goals and context

By the end of this course you will develop computer skills:

1. Clean and analyze data in Excel.
2. Analyze and graph data in R.
3. Follow recomended practices for data management and reproducible analysis.

you will be familiar with basic statistical concepts:

4. Calculate and interpret probabilities and expected values.
5. Explain the relationship between population and sample.
6. Describe the properties of a statistic or estimator including its
  probability distribution, expected value, variance, bias, and mean 
  squared error.
7. State and apply the law of large numbers and central limit theorem.

and you will be able to apply these skills in combination to analyze 
real-world economic data:

8. Construct and interpret common charts including histograms, scatter plots,
  and time-series plots.
9. Construct and interpret freqency tables and cross-tabulations.
10. Construct and interpret common univariate and bivariate statistics,
    including	mean, variance, standard deviation, covariance and correlation.
11. Construct and interpret hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.

We will be switching back and forth between theory, data analysis and
applications.  All three skill sets are valuable.

### Why this is an important course

Hopefully you are in this course because you are fascinated by the course
material, and would take it even if it wasn't required for the economics 
major. But that isn't the case for many of you, so I'd like to motivate
everyone to take this course as an opportunity to learn some very useful
skills.

Today's world is awash in data: 

- retailers maintain databases of transactions
- manufacturers track product quality and costs
- marketers collect data on customers and potential customers
- government records everyone's interactions with schools,
    tax authorities, social welfare, healthcare and criminal justice, 
- employers maintain detailed personnel records. 
 
These databases can be linked and analyzed in various ways, and many 
of the world's most successful companies rely heavily on the innovative
gathering and usage of data:

- Google's core product (the search engine) is built on the 
  analysis of massive amounts of data.
- Both Google and the major social media companies 
  are based on providing valuable "free" 
  services in order to gather data on consumers that can 
  then be sold (in some form) to other businesses.
- Amazon and other retailers use what is called A/B testing 
  to fine-tune product descriptions and set prices
  so as to maximize profits.

Some of this data analysis is done by computer scientists, but
much of it is done by economists: for example, Amazon is the 
second-largest employer of PhD economists in the US 
(after the Federal Reserve System).

I always tell students thinking about the future to remember 
supply and demand in the labour market.  In the labour market
your skills and effort are the product, and you are the seller.
Like all sellers, you want to be expensive.  This requires
that you have skills that are:

- Useful (high demand)
- Uncommon (low supply)

The ability to analyze data in a sophisticated way, and to explain
the results in written or oral presentation, is an extremely 
useful and uncommon skill. Most of you do not have the technical
skills of your colleagues in Computer Science, but if you can combine
a reasonable level of computer skills with writing, knowledge
of the underlying statistical principles, and the ability to
recognize the economic considerations in a situation, you
will do quite well.

### Related courses

ECON 233 is the first course in the two-course econometrics sequence 
that is required for all economics majors.  If you've never seen the word
before, "econometrics" just means statistics and data analysis for
economics.  In the second course (ECON 333) you will learn more advanced
techniques including linear regression, you will use R more extensively, 
and you will go deeper into the theory.

If you find you enjoy and/or do well in this course, I would strongly
encourage you to take further courses in econometrics:

- [ECON 334: Data Visualization and Economic Analysis](https://www.sfu.ca/students/calendar/2021/spring/courses/econ/334.html) 
  is an elective focusing on exploratory data analysis and visualization
 - [ECON 335: Introduction to Causal Inference and Policy Evaluation](https://www.sfu.ca/students/calendar/2021/spring/courses/econ/335.html)
  is an elective focusing on the problem of inferring cause-and-effect from
   economic data. As we will learn later this term, this problem
   is often quite difficult but crucial for economic policy choices.
 - [ECON 433: Financial and Time Series Econometrics](https://www.sfu.ca/students/calendar/2021/spring/courses/econ/433.html) is an advanced elective focusing on techniques 
   for analyzing the kind of time series data that is used in macroeconomics
   and financial markets.
 - [ECON 435: Econometric Methods](https://www.sfu.ca/students/calendar/2021/spring/courses/econ/435.html) is an advanced course in statistics 
   and econometrics that is part of our honours sequence. It gives you the
   opportunity and tools to write a serious empirical research
   paper.  Non-honours students are eligible to take it if they have 
   a 3.0 CGPA and the course prerequisites.
   
I would also encourage you to take courses outside of the economics
department, and to consider a minor in the Statistics department or the new
interdisciplinary [Social Data Analytics (SDA) minor](http://www.sfu.ca/students/calendar/2021/spring/programs/social-data-analytics/minor.html) . 

Finally, all economics majors have the option of taking ECON 233 or 
BUS 232, so you may be wondering what the difference is. Either course 
is suitable preparation for ECON 333, but there are some key differences: 

- *Tools:* ECON 233 uses both Excel and R, while BUS 232 uses Excel. 
  - You are likely to use R in ECON 333 and other upper-division ECON
    courses, so it is nice to get used to it now.
- *Applications:* ECON 233 emphasizes economics applications, while 
  BUS 232 emphasizes business applications.

ECON 233 is part of the Social Data and Analytics (SDA) minor; if you 
are an economics student and are interested in that minor you are 
recommended to take ECON 233.


## Course organization

This book is constructed under the assumptions that:

- You have taken introductory microeconomics (ECON 103 at SFU) and
  introductory macroeconomics (ECON 105 at SFU).
	We will use ideas from those courses in applications and examples.
- You have seen some probability and statistics content in high school, 
  though you may not remember much.
- You can do high-school level math including algebra and basic set theory. 
- You have access to a desktop or laptop computer, and basic computer skills.

This is not a class in introductory economics, high school math, or basic
computer skills.  If you are a little behind in those skills
you will need to ask for help, but I am happy to help anyone who asks.

## Computer resources

To do the computer work you will need a computer with internet access and
the following software packages installed:

- Microsoft Excel
- R 
- RStudio

The required software packages are available free of charge for SFU students.  They are also installed on all campus lab computers, 

I will teach the course using Windows, and can provide technical support for
Windows.  All of the necessary tools are also available for macOS, but my
ability to provide technical support is more limited. I'll do the best I can.

### Installing Microsoft Excel

Microsoft Excel is a well-known spreadsheet program that is available for both Windows 
and macOS. Alternatives to Excel include Google Sheets and Apple Numbers.

SFU has a licensing agreement with Microsoft that allows its students 
free installation of the entire Microsoft Office suite, including Excel. 
Installation instructions are available at

https://www.sfu.ca/itservices/technical/software/office365.html.

Once you have installed Excel, you should confirm that it is working by
starting the program. You should see something that looks like this:

![Excel screenshot](ExcelBlankWorkbook.png) 

### Installing R and RStudio

Later in the semester, we will also be using a more specialized statistical
program called R, and a related program called RStudio. 

- R is a programming language used for statistical analysis.
- RStudio is an "Integrated Development Environment" for R, that is
  it is an integrated set of tools for building and running R 
  programs.

Both R and RStudio are open-source, and are available free of charge for both Windows and macOS. Installation instructions are available at:

https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download.

NOTE: install R first, then RStudio.

After installing R and RStudio, you should confirm that they are working by
opening RStudio.  You should see something like this:

### Installing the Tidyverse package for R

One of the most useful features of R is that it allows users to write and
distribute ***packages*** that extend its capabilities.

One of the most popular and useful packages is called the ***Tidyverse***. R 
is a very powerful program, but it is also a very old one: the underlying
language (called "S") was originally created in 1976. The result of this 
is that some of the original commands are outdated in design and aren't
well suited for modern capabilities or principles of software development.
The Tidyverse solves this problem by adding new, more modern versions of these
commands. You can learn more about the Tidyverse at https://www.tidyverse.org/. 

To install the Tidyverse package:

1. Open RStudio if it isn't already open.
2. Click in the `Console` window (you will see it towards the bottom of the screen)
3. Type `install.packages("tidyverse")` and hit <enter>.

Once the installation is concluded and the `>` prompt reappears you can test 
to make sure the installation worked by entering the command line: `library(tidyverse)`

If you run into trouble, don't worry. We will not need the Tidyverse for 
a few weeks, so there is plenty of time to get help.
