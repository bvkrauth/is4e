# is4e - Introductory Statistics for Economics

This repository contains the Bookdown source code for my online textbook
*Introductory Statistics for Economics*.

The book itself is currently published at https://bookdown.org/bkrauth/IS4E/.
I have used it several times as the course textbook for my course
ECON 233 at Simon Fraser University, but I continue to revise it.

Other instructors are welcome to use the book in their courses, but are
strongly advised to contact me first so that I can inform you of any
substantive changes to the content.
