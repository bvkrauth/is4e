# econ233 - Textbook and supporting materials for ECON 233

This repository contains the source code (R Markdown documents) for my online textbook "Introductory statistics for economics"

The book itself is currently published at https://bookdown.org/bkrauth/BOOK/.  It is still in draft form but has been used as a 
resource in my ECON 233 course at Simon Fraser University.
