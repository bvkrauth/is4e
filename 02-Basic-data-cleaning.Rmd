# Basic data cleaning with Excel {#basic-data-cleaning-with-excel}

Before we can analyze data, we usually need to ***clean*** it. Cleaning data
means putting it into a form that is ready to analyze, and can include:

- Converting data files from one file format to another
- Reorganizing complex tables of data into simple tables
- Combining data from multiple tables into a single table
- Modifying existing variables
- Creating new variables

In this course, we will do most of our data cleaning using Excel. 

This chapter will develop both both some principles of data cleaning and the
basic Excel tools needed to implement them .  We will also apply this
knowledge by using Excel to clean a real data set.

## Application: Canadian employment data

We will demonstrate the key principles and tools in this chapter 
by cleaning the November 2020 employment data for Canadian provinces. The 
data can be found in the file  
[https://bookdown.org/bkrauth/BOOK/sampledata/CanEmpNov20.xlsx](sampledata/CanEmpNov20.xlsx) 

::: {.economics data-latex=""}
**Economics review: Employment statistics**

Employment statistics are typically covered in a Principles of
Macroeconomics course (at SFU, this course is called ECON 105). To
review the basics:

- These statistics are reported monthly by Statistics Canada and
  are based on the Labour Force Survey (LFS), a monthly survey of the
  **civilian, non-institutionalized, working-age population of Canada**.
  - "civilian" excludes those on active military duty
  - "non-institutionalized" excludes people in prison, hospitals, 
    nursing homes, etc.
  - "working-age" excludes those under age 15
  - People living on reserve are also not covered by the LFS
- The LFS population is grouped into three categories:
  - **Employed**: worked for pay or profit in the previous week, or had
    a job and was absent (e.g. due to illness or vacation).
  - **Unemployed**: not employed in the previous week, but either looking
    for work, on temporary layoff, or had a job to start within the
    next four weeks.
  - **Not in the labour force**: everyone else.  This includes retirees,
    full-time students who aren't working for pay, and anyone else
    who is neither working nor looking for work.
- These basic counts are then used to calculate several other statistics
  - The **labour force** is the total count of those who are employed or
    unemployed.
  - The **labour force participation rate** is the proportion or percentage
    of the population that is in the labour force. The Canadian
    LFP rate is typically around 65%.
  - The **unemployment rate** is the proportion of the labour force that
    is unemployed. The Canadian unemployment rate is typically 5-10%.

The unemployment rate and LFP rate are key indicators of labour market
conditions. A higher-than-usual unemployment rate means that workers
are having difficulty finding work, and a lower-than-usual LPF rate
means that some workers have stopped looking for work.

## Data cleaning principles

Next, we describe some of the core principles we will follow 
in cleaning and managing our data.

### Reproducibility {#data-management}

When analyzing data it is important for the results of our analysis to
be ***reproducible***. What that means is that an interested reader 
should be able to figure out exactly how you got your results, 
and should be able to generate those results themselves.  Note that the
"interested reader" might be *you*, as it is common to return to an
analysis you did earlier.  Without reproducibility, you may not 
remember where you found the data, what you have done with it, or 
what it means.

Reproducibility requires that we treat our data with care.  In
particular, we should:

1. Document the ***provenance*** or original source for all data.
   - When downloading data files, document the original URL and date of access.
2. Keep an unmodified copy of all original data.
   - This usually includes keeping the original file name.
3. Avoid directly editing data. Add new data instead.
   - Sometimes this is not possible or practical, which is
     why we keep an unmodified copy of the original data.
4. Give files and variables brief but informative names.
   - Avoid spaces or special characters in variable or file 
     names. They can cause problems when moving data between operating
     systems, file formats, or applications.
   - Following a naming convention may help make your names more informative

We will discuss the implementation of these principles later in this
chapter.

### Tidy data {#tidy-data}

To keep analysis easy and minimize errors, data should be organized
as what data scientists have come to call ***tidy*** data. Tidy data 
has the following seven properties:

1. Data is arranged in one or more simple rectangular grids or ***tables***.
2. Each column in a table represents a distinct ***variable*** or attribute.
3. Each variable has an informative and unique ***variable name***.
   - Variable names are typically displayed in the top row of the table.
4. Each row in a table (after the top row) represents a distinct
   ***observation***, ***data point*** or ***case***.
5. All observations in a given table come from the same 
   ***unit of observation***
   - For example, data on Canadian cities and data on Canadian provinces
     should probably be in two separate tables.
6. One variable in a table serves as a **unique identifier** or **ID** for the 
   observation.
   - A unique identifier takes on a different value for each observation.
   - The ID variable is often in the first column of the table.
7. The order in which observations or variables are listed is irrelevant to 
   the analysis. 
   - That is, the interpretation of the table would not change if its rows 
     or columns were in a different order.

Data that is not tidy is sometimes called ***messy*** data. One 
of the first steps in cleaning data is rearranging it from a messy
format to a tidy format.

### Observations and identifiers

Each tidy data set normally includes at least one unique identifier or ID 
variable. By definition, an ID variable *must* take on a different value 
for each observation.  With this property, we can use ID variables to 
link and combine data from multiple sources.

::: example
**ID variables at SFU**

SFU is one of British Columbia's largest organizations, and relies
heavily on ID variables to organize its information:

- Each person at SFU (faculty, staff or student) has a unique 16-digit ID
  number and a unique computing ID.
- Each semester at SFU has a 4-digit semester code. For example,
  Fall 2021 is assigned the semester code 1217.
- Each academic program at SFU has a 2-letter to 4-letter program code
  such as IS, BUS, or ECON.
- Each course at SFU is uniquely identified by the combination of its 
  program code (e.g. ECON) its numeric course code (e.g. 233), its section 
  number (e.g., D100), and its semester number (e.g., 1217).  
  
Your library records, grades, financial records, and almost any other 
information SFU has about you includes one or more of these IDs.
:::

The example above shows several common characteristics of ID variables:

1. They can be numbers (like your student ID number) or text 
   strings (like your computing ID). 
2. They can be 
   - Assigned sequentially or arbitrarily (like your student ID number), 
   - Constructed by a formula (like semester codes).
   - Standardized and listed in a table (like program codes)
3. An observation can sometimes be identified by combining identifiers. For 
   example, a specific course at SFU might be "ECON233-D100-1217".

ID variables should ideally be portable across applications and systems. That
is, our ID variable should still work if we move data from a Windows PC to 
a Linux or Apple system, and should still work if we move from Excel
to R or Python.  To maximize portability, keep in mind the following
potential issues:


| Issue                                       | Solution                            |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Some applications will round non-integer values (changing 1.23 to 1) or drop leading zeros (changing 00045 to 45). | Numeric ID variables should always be integers without leading zeros, or converted to text.  | 
| Some applications will reject or transform spaces or unusual characters. | Text ID variables should only use (Latin) letters and (Arabic) digits. |
| Some applications are case-sensitive (so that "hello" and "Hello" are different values) and others are not. | Text ID variables should typically use either all upper-case or all lower-case. |


It's OK for an ID variable to be nearly-but-not-exactly identical to some other variable. For
example a Canadian data set might have both a **Province** variable that takes on values like
"Qu√©bec" and "Nova Scotia" and a **ProvinceID** variable that takes on values like "QUEBEC"
and "NOVASCOTIA."

::: {.fyi data-latex=""}
**Names, IDs, and probabilistic matching**

Proper names are typically *not* used as ID variables since they are not necessarily 
unique. In addition, they are not always written 
consistently.  For example, the same person might be called "Doug" in
one data set and "Douglas" in another. 

Occasionally a data set will not have a standardized ID variable, and our only 
option is to match observations based on a proper name.  For
example, in BC school data an ID number called a PEN while health data uses a 
different ID number called a PHN. There is no direct way to match PEN and PHN, 
so we have to match education and health records on a combination of proper names 
and other information such as year of birth.  Matches made this way are 
called "probabilistic" matches, meaning (roughly) that the records probably describe
the same person but might not.
:::

## Introduction to Excel {#a-quick-tour-of-excel}

Microsoft Excel is the most commonly-used example of a ***spreadsheet***, which
is a software program designed for the tabulation, analysis, and display of
data. Its main competitors include Google Sheets and Apple Numbers. It is widely
used in business and government, so good Excel skills are valuable in the labour
market.

Many of you have probably used Excel before, but there are many features
you are probably not yet familiar with.  We will start by going over some
of its basic characteristics and terminology.

### Terminology and interface {#terminology-and-interface}

Start Excel. Your screen should look something like this:  
![Excel screenshot](bin/ExcelBlankWorkbook.png)  

When giving instructions, I will refer to various elements of Excel's user
interface by name. You may have been using these elements for years without
ever knowing their names, so I will list them here for your reference:

- The ***menu bar*** is at the top of the screen:   
   ![It shows a list of options: `File Home Insert Draw ...`.](bin/Excel menu bar.jpg)  
- The ***ribbon*** is below the menu bar  
   ![It is a row of buttons.](bin/Excel ribbon.jpg)  
  - The ribbon has buttons for performing simple actions.
  - The buttons are grouped by function, for example the ribbon above 
    depicts groups called `Clipboard`, `Font`, etc.
    - Within each function group, there is usually a little 
      ![Additional options icon](bin/Excel additional options.jpg)
      icon in the lower-right corner that you can click on to access 
      additional options.
  - If your ribbon is not visible:
    - You can make it visible by selecting `Home` (or anything else) on the
      menu bar. 
    - Once you have made the ribbon visible, you can keep it visible by
      clicking on the little thumbtack icon in its lower right corner.
  - The contents of the ribbon depend on the currently-active menu bar option
    (usually but not always `Home`). 
    - I will assume that `Home` is the currently-active option; if it isn't
      you can just select `Home` to make it the currently-active option.
- The ***formula bar*** is just below the ribbon.  
   ![the long white box ](bin/Excel formula bar.jpg) 
   - It shows the contents of the current cell.
   - You can type in it to change the contents of the current cell.
- The ***insert function*** button is to the left of the formula bar. 
   ![fx](bin/Excel insert function button.jpg){height=16pt} 
   - We will learn to use this later.
- Most of the screen displays a grid of ***cells*** that is called 
   a ***spreadsheet*** or ***worksheet***:  
   ![cell grid](bin/ExcelCellGrid.png)  
  - Columns are identified by letter.
  - Rows are identified by number.
  - Cells are identified by column and row.  For example, the cell 
    in column A, row 2 is called cell A2.
- Below the worksheet is a row of ***tabs***:
  ![tabs](bin/Excel tabs.jpg)
  - You can click on a tab to switch to that worksheet.
  - You can double-click on a tab to change its name.
  - You can click on the "+" button to add a new worksheet.
- An Excel file is called a ***workbook***.
  - Each workbook contains one or more worksheets.
  - in Windows, Excel files normally have the `.xlsx` extension. 
  - Older files sometimes have the `.xls` extension.


### Viewing data

The first step in any data cleaning exercise is to look at the data
and assess what needs to be done.

::: example
**Overview of the employment data**

Open the data file in Excel.  As you can see, this Excel workbook 
contains three worksheets:

- The worksheet *Employment Nov 2020* is our main data table:
   ![Excel screenshot](bin/EmploymentData.png) 
   It is in tidy format:
  - There is a single rectangular table starting in cell A1.
  - Each row represents a Canadian province 
  - Canadian provinces are the unit of observation
  - Each column represents a variable describing that province
  - The top row shows brief but clear names for each variable
  - The provinces are listed in alphabetical order, but the 
    interpretation of the table would not change if they were 
    listed in some other order
- The worksheet *Raw data* is the original data as downloaded from Statistics
  Canada.  
   ![Excel screenshot](bin/RawEmploymentData.png)
  It is ***messy*** (the opposite of tidy)
  - The table starts in cell A6 rather than cell A1.
  - Variables (Population, Labour Force, etc.) are in rows rather
    than columns.
  - Observations (the unit of observation is the province-month) are
    in both rows and columns.
  - Cells are filled in "implicitly".  For example, there is nothing in
    row 17 that says what province it describes, but we know that it
    describes Nova Scotia because it comes after row 16 (which does say
    it describes Nova Scotia).  As a result, the order of rows is very 
    important.
- The worksheet *Source* describes where the original data was obtained.
   ![Excel screenshot](bin/Source.png)
   - There is a text description of the data, provided by Statistics Canada.
   - There are also two URLs linking to the original data source.  Click
     on either one, or copy and paste it into your browser, to see what
     the original data source looks like.
   - There should also be some information on the date of access, but there
     currently isn't.

Note that we are following good data management practice by saving
a copy of the original data and creating a new data set based on it, rather
than by directly editing the original data.  We are also documenting
data sources.  Both of these practices will enhance the reproducibility
and reliability of our analysis.
:::

In the remainder of this section, we will learn a few tools for changing how 
our data is *displayed* that do not change the *content* of the data. 


:::fyi
**Link rot and the DOI**

One common barrier to reproducibility is "link rot" - the tendency of a given
URL to stop working over time as organizations make changes to their websites.
Most links only work for a few months or a few years, depending on the data
provider and how careful they are.

One strategy for dealing with link rot is to always save a local copy of the
data. Another is to use the digital object identifier or ***DOI*** if
one is available.  The DOI system allows organizations to provide persistent
links to web pages or other files. The *Sources* worksheet above shows both
regular and DOI addresses.

- The regular URL (https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410028703
) tells us where the file is located
  - Go to the server www150.statcan.gc.ca
  - Look in the folder/directory t1/tbl1/en/tv.action/
  - Search in the index of that folder for "pid=1410028703"
- The DOI URL (https://doi.org/10.25318/1410028701-eng) also tells us where a
  file is located, but the file at that location is not the actual data file.
  Instead it is a link that redirects the user to the address
  https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410028703.

When Statistics Canada moves the file at some point in the future, the original
URL will stop working. But the DOI will continue working as long as they update
the DOI entry with the new URL.
:::


### Sorting, filtering, and freezing

***Sorting*** allows us to re-order the rows of our data based on 
the value in one or more of the columns.  Since order does not matter
with tidy data, we can sort in whatever way we like without changing
the content of our data.

::: fyi
Before sorting data, always make sure that the order of rows does not
convey important information.
:::


::: example
**Sorting the employment data**

The original data are in alphabetical order by province name. But suppose 
we wanted it to be ordered by population (with the largest provinces on top)
instead. Here's all we need to do:

1. Select any cell in the **Population** column.
2. Select `Home > Sort and Filter > Sort Largest to Smallest`.

As you can see, the data set is now sorted by population. We can follow
similar steps to put the data set back in alphabetical order:

1. Select any cell in the **Province** column.
2. Select `Home > Sort and Filter > Sort A to Z`.

Notice that Excel can tell whether a column contains numbers or text, and 
will sort accordingly. 
:::

You can sort in ascending or descending order, and you can sort on 
multiple columns by selecting the "Custom sort" option.

***Filtering*** allows us to hide some observations so we can 
look at a particular subset of observations that we are interested 
in. The hidden observations are still there, so this is a much safer option
than deleting observations.

::: example
**Filtering the employment data**

Suppose we only want to see data for larger provinces. Here's what we can do:

1. Select `Home > Sort and Filter > Filter`. If you look at the column headers 
   in your sheet you will see that they have become drop-down boxes.
3. Click on the drop-down box for **Population**, then select 
   `Number filters > Greater Than...`
4. Enter one million (`1000000`) in the box and select `OK`.

At this point, only the provinces with at least one million residents
appear in the table. Don't worry, the other ones haven't gone anywhere.

We can undo the filter and remove the drop-down boxes by selecting
`Home > Sort and Filter > Filter` again.
:::

You can filter on more complex criteria, and you can combine
sorting and filtering.

***Freezing panes*** keeps some rows and/or columns visible regardless 
of which cell is currently selected.  This allows us to work with large
tables while keeping the top row (variable names) and/or the first 
column (observation IDs) visible.

::: example
**Freezing panes**

Go down to row 50 or so in your worksheet. Notice that you can't 
see the variable names in row 1 any more. This is fine for our current
data set, but it would be a problem if we had more than a few rows.

1. Go back to cell A1.
2. Select `View > Freeze Panes > Freeze Top Row`.

Now go back down to row 50 or so. You will see that the top row is still
displayed and you can see the variable names.

To undo this, select `View > Freeze Panes > Unfreeze Panes`.
:::

Instead of freezing the first row, you can freeze the first column, or
you can freeze any number of rows and columns.

### Cell formatting {#cell-formatting}

Another way we can change the appearance of our data without changing
its content is to adjust the ***cell formatting*** for one or more
cells.  Cell formatting characteristics include:

- Column width
- Row height
- Font
- Bold/italics/underline
- Text color
- Background color
- Cell borders
- Alignment (left/right/center as well as top/bottom/middle) 

The procedure for modifying the cell format is straightforward if you 
regularly use productivity applications like Microsoft Word.

::: example
**Changing cell size**

You may notice that cell B8 (Ontario population) appears to contain "######" 
rather than a number.  The cause of this problem is that the cell is not wide
enough to display the correct number. So let's make it wider.

We have several options for doing this:

- *From the menu*: Select any cell in column B, and then select 
  `Home > Format > Cell Width...`.  A dialog box will appear that allows you
  to enter your preferred width. Try 10.
- *With the mouse*: Move your cursor to the line between column headers B 
  and C until the cursor looks like this: ![cursor](bin/cell width change.png){height=16pt}. Click on the mouse and drag the cursor to
  resize the column.
- *Auto-fit* (this is what I usually do):  Move your cursor to the 
  line between column headers B and C, and double-click.  The column 
  width will automatically adjust to fit the data.
  
You can follow similar procedures to adjust the row height, but we do not need
to do that here.
:::

Another important cell formatting characteristic is the number format,
which will be discussed in a later section.

## Cleaning data {#cleaning-data}

We are now ready to start actively cleaning our data. Since our data set is
already tidy, this will mostly involve defining new variables based on the
existing variables.

### Preparation

We start by making two copies of our data set:

1. The original file, exactly as we received it.
2. A ***working copy*** under a new name.

Recall that one of our core principles of reproducibility is to 
always keep an unmodified copy of the original data.  We will do any
modifications or additions in the working copy.  

::: example
**Creating a working copy**

Save your Excel workbook, giving it a *different* name from the name 
of the original data file. 

As we proceed through the example application, be sure to save your
working copy each time you make a significant modification or addition.
:::

The next step is to look at the data and construct a cleaning plan. Your 
cleaning plan should have several steps:

1. Convert all data into tidy-format tables.
2. Ensure that each table has a unique ID variable.
3. Identify and address problems in existing variables.
4. Create new variables that may be useful.
5. Link data across tables.

The data cleaning plan should be based around what we plan to do 
with the data, but should preserve flexibility in case we want to
use the data for other purposes.

::: example
**A plan for cleaning the employment data**

The first step in cleaning the employment data is to ensure
we have tidy data.  This step has already been completed, so
we can move on.

The second step is to ensure that each table has a unique
ID variable. In our employment data, the province name
*could* serve as a unique identifier, but names typically have some drawbacks:

- Names are not always unique. This is obviously not an issue with Canadian 
  provinces, but it is an issue in many other data sets. For example, there 
  are 41 cities and towns in the United States named "Springfield." 
- The same observation often appears with different names in different 
  data sets.  For example, some older data sets call the province of 
  Newfoundland and Labrador just "Newfoundland" as that was the province's 
  name before December 6, 2001.

As a result, it is typically not advisable to use names as ID 
variables. Instead, we could:

- Use a **standardized code** such as the two-letter postal abbreviation.
- Assign an arbitrary number to each observation.

We will do both. This is not necessary, but allows us to see the relative
benefits of the two approaches

The third step is to identify and address problems in our existing
variables. Following the general principle to avoid editing data, we will
do this by creating new-and-improved versions of these variables rather than
editing the existing variables.

The fourth step is to consider is whether there
are any variables we would like to analyze that have not yet
been constructed.  In our employment data, we will want to construct

- Labour force
- Labour force participation rate
- Unemployment rate

We will also want to include information on which specific month 
these observations are describing (November 2020).  Although that 
information is in the *Raw data* worksheet and in the title of 
the main worksheet (*Employment Nov 2020*) it may be useful to 
have it in the table as well.
:::

We will now add several variables to our working data set. Be sure to save 
the file after adding each variable so that you don't lose your work.

### Inserting cells

Most of the time we will add data to the end of the existing table, adding
new variables after the last column or new observations after the last row. But
occasionally we will want to insert a column or row into our table.

::: example
**Adding a column for the ID variable**

We will want our first column to include a not-yet-constructed ID
variable, so we need to insert a column to the left.

1. Select any cell in column A.
2. Select `Home > Insert > Insert Sheet Columns` from the menu.

This will shift all columns to the right, and insert a new blank
column A.
:::

We can also insert rows, delete rows or columns, and even insert or
delete individual cells.

### Data entry, fill and series {#entering-new-data}

The simplest way to add a variable to an Excel table is by typing data
directly into the cells.  

::: example
**Entering data**

As we discussed earlier, we would like to add the two-letter postal abbreviation for each province:

| Province or Territory| ProvAbb |
|:---------------------|:-------:|
| Alberta                   | AB |
| British Columbia          | BC |
| Manitoba                  | MB |
| New Brunswick             | NB |
| Newfoundland and Labrador | NL | 
| Northwest Territories     | NT |
| Nova Scotia               | NS |
| Nunavut                   | NU |
| Ontario                   | ON |
| Prince Edward Island      | PE | 
| Quebec                    | QC |
| Saskatchewan              | SK |
| Yukon                     | YT |

The postal abbreviation is useful for at least two reasons

1. It is *standardized*, while the full province name may not be.
   - The postal abbreviations were originally created by Canada Post.
   - They are also internationally recognized through the ISO standard
     [ISO 3166-2](https://www.iso.org/standard/72483.html).
2. It is *short*, which can be useful in charts.

To add this variable:

1. Enter **ProvAbb** in cell F1 to name the variable.
2. Fill in cells F2:F11 with the correct postal abbreviation.
:::


::: fyi
**Choosing variable names**

It takes a little bit of thought to choose brief and informative variable names
that work well, but you will be glad you did it.

1. Variable names need to be *unique*.
   - **Province** would have been a nice short and clear variable name,
     but it was already taken.
2. Variable names should be *informative*.
   -  **X** or **my variable** would have been bad variable names.
   - So would **Province2**.
3. Variable names should be *short*. In some older programs, variable names
   can be no longer than 8 characters long. Most modern programs allow
   much longer variable names, but long variable names are harder
   to remember, harder to type without errors, and less likely to
   display cleanly.
   - 8 characters is a good target, but it's OK to go a little over that.
   - Abbreviation is a good way to shorten names, so we use
     **ProvAbb** instead of **ProvinceAbbreviation**.
4. Variable names should *avoid spaces and special characters*:
   - Special characters are anything other than the Latin letters (a through z),
     Arabic digits (0 through 9), and the underscore `_`.
   - When constructing variable names from multiple words, there are several
     standard methods of distinguishing between the words:
     - Pascal case: **ProvAbb**
     - Camel case:  **provAbb**
     - Snake case: **prov_abb**
5. Variable names should be treated as *potentially case independent*.
   - Some programs like R treat variable names as ***case dependent***, and
     will consider **ProvAbb**, **provabb**, **provAbb** and **PROVABB** four
     different variables.
   - Other programs like SAS treat variable names as **case independent**,
     so these four names all refer to the same variable.
   - So once we create a variable called **ProvAbb** we should never
     create another variable called **provabb**, **provAbb**, or
     **PROVABB**, just in case we want to use this data set in SAS.
6. Variable naming conventions should be *consistent* within each data set.
   - We could have used camel case or snake case for our new variable, but
     the existing variables use Pascal case so we should use Pascal case
     for all new variables too.

To be honest, Excel allows nearly anything in a variable name since it does not
normally use the variable names in its calculations.  But good naming practices
are still important since you may need to move data between programs.
:::

Excel also has several tools available to speed the process of entering
data.  First, you can ***copy-and-paste*** or ***cut-and-paste*** the contents
of any cell into any other cell.  I'll assume you know how to do this, though
there are a few special tricks we will cover later on.

Excel's ***fill*** tool allows you to quickly copy the contents
of a cell into a set of cells immediately, above, below or
to the left or right.

::: example
**Using fill**

Our data cleaning plan includes adding a variable indicating which month 
and year these particular observations describe (November 2020).

1. Enter **MonthYr** in cell G1 to name the variable.
2. Enter "11/20" in cell G2.
   - You may notice that Excel displays the date differently from
     how you entered it - on my computer it displays as `Nov-20` but yours
     may look different. We will talk more later about how Excel handles dates.

Now we could enter the exact same date in cells G3:G11, but we can save
ourselves some time by using Excel's fill tool:

3. Select cells G2:G11.
4. Select `Home > Fill > Down`.
 
As you can see, Excel fills in all selected cells with the value in the 
top cell.
:::

Excel's ***series*** tool allows you to fill in a group of cells
with an ascending or descending sequence of numbers or dates.

::: example
**Using series**

Let's create a unique sequential ID variable in column A. We can enter 
these ID numbers by hand, but there is an easier way using
Excel's series tool:

1. Enter **ID** in cell A1 to name the variable.
2. Enter 1 in cell A2.
3. Select cells A2:A11.
4. Select `Fill > Series...`.  The Series dialog box will appear.
5. There are several options for constructing a series. Fortunately, the
   default is exactly what we want, so select `OK`.

As you can see, column A now contains a unique identifier that numbers provinces
from 1 to 10.

**Some useful Excel shortcuts**

Switching between your keyboard and mouse/touchpad/touchscreen can be annoying
and time-consuming.  You can speed up your work by learning a few handy
keyboard shortcuts.

The first set of shortcuts is that you can navigate around your spreadsheet by
using the arrow, `Home`, `End`, `PgUp` and `PgDn` keys. Try using them in
combination with the `Ctrl` key (which typically takes you to the end of the
spreadsheet) or the `Shift` key (which typically selects a group of cells).

In addition, most commonly used menu items have associated keyboard shortcuts.
These are the ones I find most useful:

| Action        | Shortcut         |
|:--------------|:----------------:|
| Cut           | `Ctrl-x`         |
| Copy          | `Ctrl-c`         |
| Paste         | `Ctrl-v`         |
| Fill Down     | `Ctrl-d`         |
| Fill Right    | `Ctrl-r`         |
| Undo          | `Ctrl-z`         |
| Cancel edit   | `Esc`            |
| Clear cell    | `Del`            |
| Save file     | `Ctrl-s`         |
| Bold          | `Ctrl-b`         |
| Italics       | `Ctrl-i`         |
| Underline     | `Ctrl-u`         |

### Formulas {#formulas}

Most of our new variables will be calculated from existing variables
using ***formulas***. A formula is just a rule for calculating a value
from some other values.

Formulas always start with the equals sign `=` followed by a mathematical
expression that can include any combination of:

- Specific values, for example `=2` or `=TRUE`
- References to other cells, for example `=D2`
- Standard arithmetic operators, for example `=2+2` or `=D2/4`
- Functions, for example `=SQRT(D2)` or `=SUM(D2:D10)`.

Formulas can be simple, or they can be quite complex.

::: example
**Calculating the labour force**

Returning to our application, everyone who is either employed or unemployed
is in what economists call the "labour force." So let's add that variable.

1. Enter **LabourForce** in cell H1 to name the variable.
   - Note that I avoid putting spaces in variable names. This is a habit of
     mine when working with data, because spaces can cause complications 
     when moving data across systems, e.g. from Excel to R.
2. Enter `= D2 + E2` in cell H2.

Cell H2 now displays `2,493,300` which is in fact the value in cell D2 
plus the value in cell E2. 
:::

As discussed earlier, it is important to distinguish between what is
the *contents* of a cell and how those contents are *displayed*. For
example, the true contents of cell H2 in our example above are the
formula `= D2 + E2` but the cell shows the number  `2,493,300`. If 
you change the number in cell D2 or cell E2, the number shown in
cell H2 will adjust accordingly.

Formulas can use the results from other formulas, as shown in 
the example below.

::: example
**Calculating unemployment and LFP rates**

Let's add a column for the labour force participation rate. To remind you,
this is the proportion or percentage of the population (column C) that is in
the labour force (column H).

1. Enter **LFPRate** in cell I1 to name the variable.
2. Enter `=H2/C2` in cell I2 to calculate the variable.

Let's also add a column for the unemployment rate.  To remind you, this is
the proportion or percentage of the labour force (column H) that is
unemployed (column E).

3. Enter **UnempRate** in cell J1 to name the variable.
4. Enter `=E2/H2` in cell J2 to calculate the variable.

Notice that both of these formulas use cell H2, which itself contains 
a formula. It is often useful to break up a complex formula into steps
like this, as it is easier to check your work and spot problems.
:::


### Functions {#built-in-functions}

Excel has about 500 built-in ***functions*** that we can use in formulas. Each
function has a ***function name*** and a set of ***arguments*** whose values you
can set.

To use a function, you simply include its name and its arguments as 
part of the formula.  For example, the `SQRT()` function takes a single
numeric argument and returns the square root of the argument. So if
you enter `=SQRT(2)` in a cell, the cell will display `1.414`, the 
square root of 2. You can use the contents of other cells as an argument,
or you can also use the result of another function.

Excel also has extensive tools for:

- Finding the function you need for a particular calculation task.
- Figuring out what arguments to use in the function.

You can also use a search engine like Google to find this information.

::: example
**A simple function**

Suppose we want to add a new variable for the (natural) log of population.

1. Enter **LogPop** in cell K1 to give the variable a name.
2. Select cell K2.
3. If we already know the name of the function for taking the natural 
   log, we can just type in our formula.  But suppose we don't know 
   the name of the function, or even whether there is such a function.
   a. Click on the insert function button 
      ![insert function button](bin/Excel insert function button.jpg){height=16pt} 
      to the left of the formula bar.
   b. The `Insert Function` dialog box will appear.
      ![insert function dialog box](bin/InsertFunction.png)
      It will show a long list of functions. You will want to narrow this list
      down, and you have several options for doing so:
      - Search: Enter `logarithm` in the `Search for a function` text box.
      - Browse: Select `Math & Trig` from the `Or select a category`
        drop-down box.
   c. Once you have narrowed the list down, it is easy to find the 
      function you want (`LN`). Select `LN` from the `Select a function`
      list box, and then select `OK`.You will now see the `Function Arguments`
      dialog box for the `LN` function.
      ![function arguments dialog box](bin/FunctionArguments.png)
4. As you can see, the `LN` function takes one argument (the number you want 
   the log of). You want to take the log of cell C2, so enter the text `C2` 
   here or click on cell C2.
   - the dialog box will display the value in cell C2 (`3588700`)
     as well as the calculated value for the log of cell
     C2 (`15.0933058`).
6. Select `OK`.

You will see that cell K2 now contains `=LN(C2)` which displays as `15.0933`. 
Note that if you already knew the function and arguments you needed, you could 
have just typed `=LN(C2)` into cell K2 instead.
:::

### Cell ranges {#cell-ranges}

Some functions like `SUM()` and `AVERAGE()` operate on a ***range*** of cells
rather than a single cell. A range is just a rectangular set of cells, 
and is described by its upper-left and lower-right cells, separated 
by a colon (":"). For example:

- Range A2:A5 consists of cells A2, A3, A4 and A5.
- Range A2:C2 consists of cells A2, B2, and C2.
- Range A2:B3 consists of cells A2, B2, A3, and C3.

A single cell can also be thought of as a range of cells with one
row and one column.

::: example
**Total population**

Suppose we want to create a new variable that reports the total population
across all observations in the data. The function to do that is `SUM()`. 

1. Enter **TotPop** in cell L1 to give the variable a name,
2. Enter `=SUM(C2:C11)` in cell L2.  

Cell L2 should display `31,275,600` which is indeed the sum of 
cells C2 to C11.
:::

### Copying formulas {#copying-pasting-and-relative-references}

In Excel, you can copy-and-paste the contents of a cell to any 
other cell. This is particularly handy when a cell contains a 
formula, as it would be inconvenient to type the same formula 
into each cell.

::: example
**Copying a formula**

To use copy-and-paste to copy the formula in cell H2 to the 
other cells in column H:

1. Select cell H2 and copy it.
2. Select cells H3:H11 and paste.

:::

You can also use fill for this purpose, and it is usually
quicker.

::: example
**Filling a formula**

To use fill to copy the formulas in cells I2:L2 to the other 
cells in columns I through L:

3. Select cells I2:L11
4. Select `Home > Fill > Down`

:::

### Relative and absolute references 

Excel is smart and normally treats cell addresses in formulas 
as ***relative references*** when copying and pasting cells.  That
is, when a formula is copied to another cell $r$ columns to the right
and $d$ rows down, the column letters in the formula are increased
by $r$ units, and the row numbers are increased by $d$ units.

For example, suppose cell B5 contains the formula `=A1`.  If
we copy the contents of this cell to other cells, we get:

|  Cell  | Formula |
|--------|:-------:|
|   B5   | =A1     |
|   B6   | =A2     |
|   B7   | =A3     |
|   C5   | =B1     |
|   D5   | =C1     |
|   C6   | =B2     |
|   D7   | =C3     |

This is usually exactly what we want Excel to do. 

::: example
**Relative references**

Select cell H3 and take a look at the formula bar. You'll notice that
while the original cell H2 contains `=D2+E2`, cell H3 actually contains
`=D3+E3`. This is exactly what we would want; each cell in column H
calculates the province's labour force by adding together the unemployed
and employed counts from the same province (i.e. same row).
:::

Sometimes we will want Excel to treat cell references as 
***absolute references*** instead.  That is, we want to copy the cell 
reference exactly as written. 

::: example
**Total population, part 2**

Take a look at the **TotPop** variable in column L.  This variable 
is supposed to represent the total Canadian population, but each 
cell in this column shows a different number.

Because Excel treats cell references as relative, copying the 
cell L2 to the rest of column L produces:
- Cell L2 contains `=SUM(C2:C11)`
- Cell L3 contains `=SUM(C3:C12)`
- Cell L4 contains `=SUM(C4:C13)`

but in this case we want *all* of the cells to contain `=SUM(C2:C11)`.
:::

We can tell Excel to treat a given cell reference as absolute by
adding the `$` character to the cell reference. For example, 
suppose that we copy the formula in cell C2 to cell D3. Then:

|  If cell C2 contains  | Then cell D3 contains |
|-----------------------|:---------------------:|
|   `=A1`               | `=B2`                 |
|   `=$A1`              | `=$A2`                |
|   `=A$1`              | `=B$1`                |
|   `=$A$1`             | `=$A$1`               |
 
Note that the presence or absence of the `$` does not affect the
calculation in the cell, it only affects how the formula is copied
over to other cells.

::: example
**Total population, part 2**

To fix the **TotPop** variable:

1. Go back to cell L2.
2. Change `=SUM(C2:C11)` to `=SUM(C$2:C$11)`.
   - Notice that the value in this cell does not change.
3. Copy/paste or fill cell L2 into cells L3:L11.
   - Notice that all cells in this column contain the same formula
      (`=SUM(C$2:C$11)`) and display the same value (`31,275,600`)

This is what we want.
:::

Sometimes we will want to combine absolute and relative references in the
same formula.  This typically will happen when we want to compare the 
current observation to the other observations.

:::example
**Population rank**

Suppose we want to create a new variable that is the province's population
*rank*. That is, the province with the highest population has a rank of 1, 
second highest has a rank of 2, etc. The function to do that is `RANK.EQ()`,
which takes two arguments: the value to rank, and the list of values
to use for the ranking.  We want the first argument (the province's population)
to vary across provinces, but we want the list of values (the populations of
all of the provinces) to stay the same.

1. Enter **PopRank** in cell M1 to give the variable a name.
2. Select cell M2.
3. Use the `Insert Function` tool to access the arguments for `RANK.EQ()`. Enter
   the appropriate arguments and select `OK`:
   - `Number` is the number we wish to rank: enter C2 for Alberta's population.
   - `Ref` is the set of values we want to rank within: enter the range `C$2:C$11`
     for the list of all provinces' populations.
   - `Order` is an optional argument: leave it blank.
4. Copy/paste or fill cell M2 into cells M3:M11.

As you can see, Excel displays the correct ranks. We can check this by sorting
on **Population** and seeing if **PopRank** is also sorted.
:::

::: {.fyi data-latex=""}
**Advanced options**

The `RANK.EQ()` function has several relatives with similar syntax:

- The `RANK()` and `RANK.AVG()` functions also return the rank, but
  use slightly different rules for handling ties.
- The `PERCENTRANK()`, `PERCENTRANK.EXC()` and `PERCENTRANK.INC()` 
  functions return ranks in percentiles.
:::

## Data types {#excel-data-types}

Most of the data we work with is numeric. However, there are other types
of information we regularly encounter:

- Text
- Logical (true/false) values
- Dates and times

Excel has various tools for entering, storing and processing 
these data types.

### Numeric data {#numeric-data}

Most modern computer applications, including Excel, do numeric calculations
in double-precision (64-bit) binary floating point format.  Calculations in
this format are typically accurate up to the 15th decimal place.

But the results of these calculations are typically displayed to 
fewer decimal places than that.  A cell's contents are distinct 
from its ***numeric display format***, which is how it appears 
on the screen. We can change the display format of a cell or 
group of cells without changing its contents. 

::: example
**Displaying unemployment and LFP rates as percentages**

Both **UnempRate** and **LFPRate** are calculated as proportions 
(a number between 0 and 1). But we might prefer to display them 
as percentages (a number between 0 and 100).

We *could* change the formulas (for example, change the `LPFRate` 
formula to `=100*H2/C2`) or we could just change the cells'
display format:

1. Select cells I2:J11.
2. Select `Home > Number Format` (it is a little drop down box that 
   currently displays `General`), and then select `Percentage`.

You will see that the cell now displays the rates in percentage, to
two decimal places.  I think it would be more readable if we round to 
just one decimal place.  To do that, select `Home > Decrease Decimal`.
:::

An important thing to understand here: all we have done is change how
the numbers are *displayed*.  If we do any calculations with these
cells, the calculation will use the original proportional value
without rounding.

### Text data {#text-data}

***Text data*** is also called ***character data*** or 
***string data***. In Excel, text values can be entered directly in a 
cell, can be used in a formula, and can be the result of a formula.

Excel has many functions for working with text data.  A particularly useful one is
the `CONCAT()` function, which allows you to join or ***concatenate***
two or more strings. This is useful in building reports, in constructing
ID variables, and in many other applications.

::: example
**Using CONCAT()**

To use the `CONCAT()` function to create a sentence
that describes our data as if it we were writing a written report.

1. Enter **Description** in cell N1 to name the variable
2. Enter `=CONCAT(C2," people live in ",B2)` in cell N2. 
   - The cell should display `3588700 people live in Alberta`
3. Copy/paste/fill in cells N3:N11.

As you can see, `CONCAT()` is useful for converting data into human-readable 
statements. It is also useful for constructing ID variables.
:::



::: {.fyi data-latex=""}
**Advanced options**

There are many useful functions to manipulate text strings in Excel:

- `LEN()` calculates the length (number of characters) of a string. 
   For example: 
   - `=LEN("Hello world!")` returns the value of 12. 
- `MID()` allows you to extract part of a string.  For example 
   - `=MID("Hello world!",2,3)` returns a value of "ell".  
- `UPPER()`, `LOWER()` and `PROPER()` allow you to change the case of a string.
   For example:
   - `=UPPER("Hello world!")` returns "HELLO WORLD!".
   - `=LOWER("Hello world!")` returns "hello world!".
   - `=PROPER("Hello world!")` returns "Hello World!".
- `FIND()` allows you to find a particular substring within a larger string.
   For example:
   - `=FIND("world!","Hello world!")` returns 7
- `REPLACE()` allows you to replace part of a string. For example:
   - `=REPLACE("Hello world!",7,5,"mom")` returns "Hello mom!"
:::

### Logical data {#logical-data}

In addition to text and numbers, cells can also contain ***logical***
values (`TRUE` or `FALSE`). Logical values can be entered directly 
in a cell, can be used in a formula, and can be the result of a formula.

Mathematical expressions using the ***comparison operators*** 
`=` (equal), `<>` (not equal),
`>` (greater than), `<` (less than), 
`>=` (greater than or equal),  and `<=` (less then or equal) 
can be used to create logical values.

::: example
**Creating a logical variable**

To create a logical variable that indicates whether a province has 
a labour force participation rate below 64%.

1. Enter **LowLFP** in cell O1 to name the variable.
2. Enter `=(I2 < 0.64)` in cell O2.
   - Notice that `(I2 < 0.64)` is a *statement* that is either
     true or false, not a numeric expression.
   - Logical statements can use other comparison operators, 
     including `=`, `<`, `>`, and `<=`.
3. Copy/paste or fill cell O2 into cells O3:O11.

As you can see, the cells display `TRUE` in the three provinces 
with LFP rates below 64%, and `FALSE` in the other seven.
:::

Logical values are particularly powerful in combination with the
`IF()` function.  This function takes three arguments:

- a statement.
- a value to return if the statement is true.
- a value to return if the statement is false.

::: example
**Using IF() to create an indicator variable**

An ***indicator*** variable is the numerical version of a logical
variable: it takes on the value 1 if a particular statement
is true, and 0 if the statement is false.  

To create an indicator variable for low labour force 
participation:

1. Enter **LowLFPInd** in cell P1 to name the variable.
2. Enter `=IF(I2 < 0.64,1,0)` in cell P2.
3. Copy/paste or fill cell P2 into cells P3:P11.

As you can see, the cells display `1` in the three provinces 
with LFP rates below 64%, and `0` in the other seven. When cleaning
data we will typically use indicator variables rather than logical
variables.
:::



::: {.fyi data-latex=""}
**Advanced options**

Some additional functions that work with logical variables:

- `NOT()` returns `TRUE` if its argument is `FALSE` and 
   `FALSE` if its argument is `TRUE`.
- `AND()` returns `TRUE` if *all* of its arguments are `TRUE`.
- `OR()` returns `TRUE` if *any* of its arguments are `TRUE`.
- `SWITCH()` and `IFS()` are extensions of `IF()` that take 
   multiple conditions.
:::

### Dates and times {#dates-and-times}

In additions to numbers, text, and logical values, Excel can handle ***dates***
and ***times***.  Dates and times are a surprisingly complex subject
that can create all sorts of problems on a computer, for several reasons:

- There are many conventional ways of writing the same date:
   - November 1, 2020
   - 2020 November 1
   - 14 Heshvan 5781 (Hebrew calendar)
   - 11/1/2020
   - 11/1/20
   - 11-1-2020
   - 2020/11/1
   - etc.
- Conventions vary across cultures and organizations
  - in some places 11/1 means November 1 and in others it means January 11.
- We want to be able to sort and rank in time order rather than alphabetical
  order:
  - January 10, 2020 should come before December 10, 2020.
- We want to be able to add and subtract dates and times
  - January 4, 2021 comes 5 days after December 30, 2020.
- We want to handle time zones, daylight savings time, leap years,
  and even leap seconds.
- We want to do this in a way that is perfectly accurate, but 
  hides all of these complexities in normal usage.

As you might imagine, this is not easy. Each application has its own rules for
handling dates and times, but there are some standards that have developed.
Excel handles dates and times as follows:

1. Dates are *stored* as the number of days elapsed since some base 
   date. In Excel the base date is January 1, 1900, which means that
   - January 1, 1900 is day 1.
   - January 2, 1900 is day 2.
   - November 1, 2020 is day 44136.
2. Dates are *displayed* according to the cell's display formatting. 
   - The default display formatting varies across regions, so 
     the same date in the same Excel file might appear different
     on your computer and my computer.
3. When you enter something into a cell that looks like a date, Excel does
   several things behind the scenes:
   - it guesses the date format for what you have entered
   - it converts what you have entered to the internal storage form (days since base date).
   - it changes the display format to what Excel thinks it should be (based on your location
     settings).

Most of the time, this system works seamlessly and you don't even notice it. But
it can cause problems, and understanding the underlying structure can help you
to solve those problems.

::: example
**How dates are stored and displayed**

The **MonthYr** variable in column G is a date.  Remember that we created it
by typing in "11/20". Let's see what Excel did with that.

1. Select cell G2. Notice that (at least on my computer):
   - The cell displays `Nov-20`
   - The formula bar displays `11/1/2020`.
2. To see how Excel sees this date, change the cell's number format 
   from `Custom` (on your computer it might be `Date`) to `General`
   - Now the cell displays `44136`, which is the date-time value that Excel
     assigns to November 1, 2020.

Now while a date of 44136 is quite clear to Excel, we want to display
dates in a more human-readable way.  I don't like the `Nov-20` display
format, since it isn't obvious whether that means November 2020 or
November 20. So let's change the formatting:

3. Select cells G2:G11.
4. Select `Number Format > Short Date`.

You can see even more options if you select `More number formats`
:::

We can also do calculations with dates, and there are various functions
using dates. 

::: example
**Some date calculations**

To calculate how long ago November 2020 was:

1. Enter **Today** in cell Q1 to name the variable
2. Enter `=TODAY()` in cell Q2 to put in today's date.
   - This will display today's date.
   - Tomorrow, the cell will display tomorrow's date.
3. Enter **HowLongAgo** in cell R1.
4. Enter `=Q2-G2` in cell R2.
   - This will display the number of days that have passed between
      November 1, 2020 and today.
5. If you have not already done so, save your data file.

Most of the time, Excel's handling of dates works seamlessly and is
very clever. But sometimes Excel guesses wrong, and this can create
all sorts of problems. 

::: {.fyi data-latex=""}
**Excel dates and genetics**

Excel's handling of dates caused a significant unanticipated problem
in the the field of human genetics, where it is a widely used
tool.

Each gene has a standard abbreviation like "TCEA1" or "CTCF" assigned
by a scientific body called the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC). 
Unfortunately, 27 of these genes have abbreviations that Excel 
misinterprets as dates, for example "Membrane Associated Ring-CH-Type 
Finger 2," also known as "MARCH2". If you enter the text "MARCH2" in 
an Excel cell, Excel will automatically convert it to the date of 
March 2 in the current year. A 2016 research paper found that roughly 
20% of published research articles in the field used data that was 
affected by this problem.

Unfortunately, it is too late to "fix" Excel to keep this from 
happening. Any change to its behavior would "break" Excel in thousands
of other applications that rely on its current behavior. 

When you can't fix a problem in a computer application, you need to
find a ***workaround***: a modification to how you
use the application that avoids or minimizes the effects of the 
problem. So the HGNC changed the names of these 27 genes in  2020. For 
example, the gene MARCH2 is now called MARCHF2.

In addition to dates, Excel can also handle date-time values such as 
`11/1/2020  12:00:00 PM`.  

::: {.fyi data-latex=""}
**How Excel handles times**

Excel treats times as partial days. For example,
Excel will store `11/1/2020  12:00:00 PM` as day number `44136.5`
and `11/1/2020  1:00:00 PM` as day number `44136.5416666667`. 

There are also functions that work with date-time values.  For
example, we have already seen the function `TODAY(.)` which returns the 
current date but there is also a function `NOW(.)` that returns the current
date and time.

## Version control {#version-control}

The last step in cleaning data is to save your work. In fact, you should
be saving it regularly so that you don't lose work if something goes wrong.

::: example
**Saving your work**

If you have not already done so, save your cleaned employment data file
now. Remember to give it a brief but informative name; I chose
`CanEmpNov20Clean.xlsx`.

You can compare it to my version at
[https://bookdown.org/bkrauth/BOOK/sampledata/CanEmpNov20Clean.xlsx](sampledata/CanEmpNov20Clean.xlsx) 
:::

In a simple setting, this is all you need to do. But as your projects get 
more complex, you may find yourself keeping multiple versions of your data 
file. There are many reasons to do this:

 - Maybe you are trying something new, and are keeping an earlier version
   in case something goes wrong.
 - Maybe you did an analysis a few weeks ago that you are no longer using,
   but you don't want to throw it away in case you change your mind.
 - Maybe you and a classmate are working on a project together, and you
   have each made changes to separate copies of the original file.

You will want to use some form of ***version control*** here, with a goal
of keeping everything you might need later, but without making mistakes
or spending a lot of time on it.  Version control is an important element in
making your analysis reproducible.

Software developers and professional data analysts (like me) use a formal
version control system like [GitHub](https://github.com/). GitHub
tracks every change made to a group of files, and can allow multiple
users to work together on a project without getting in each other's
way.

For our purposes, we can just follow a few simple rules:

- Always have one ***working copy***, which is the file you are actively working
  on right now.
- Always have one ***master version***, which is the most recently saved file that
  is "complete."
   - You should try to work in small and distinct projects (like adding a single
     variable or group of related variables) so that you can
     1. Make a working copy of the master version.
     2. Complete a project in your working copy.
     3. Make this working copy the new master version.
   - There should always be exactly one master version of a given document.
- As needed, you can keep any number of ***archived versions***, which are
   earlier master versions (or occasionally earlier working copies) that
   you wish to keep around for some reason.
   - You may choose to save every previous master version.  GitHub does this
     automatically.
   - You may choose to save just a few important ones.  At minimum, this should
     include any version you have sent to anyone else and any version
     used to generate results you have sent to someone else.
   - Use some consistent naming convention to distinguish between archived 
     versions. For example, I add a date code to the end like "210907" which
     means that this file was the master version as of September 7, 2021.
     
At this level, you do not normally need to keep archived versions.  But you
should at least distinguish between your master version and working copy, and to
update your master version regularly. At some point you are guaranteed to make
a catastrophic mistake in your working copy and you will be glad to have a
master copy from before the mistake.

## Chapter review {-#review-basic-data-cleaning-with-excel}

Data cleaning is among the most important practical skills one can develop in 
applied statistical analysis. Simple statistical methods like averages
and frequencies are all most people will ever use, but everyone who works
with data regularly encounters complex and messy data in need of cleaning.

In this chapter, we have learned some important data cleaning concepts, including
reproducible research, tidy data, ID variables, and version control.  We have also 
learned how to implement these concepts in Excel using tools such as fill/series, 
sorting, formatting, formulas, and functions.  

We will soon use Excel to do some 
[basic statistical analysis and graphing](#basic-data-analysis-with-excel)
using our cleaned data. Later on, we will learn more 
[advanced data cleaning](#advanced-data-cleaning)
concepts such as linking, aggregating, error validation/handling, 
importing and exporting, as well has how to to implement them in both Excel 
and R.

## Practice problems {-#problems-basic-data-cleaning-with-excel}
