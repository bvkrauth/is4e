# Basic data analysis with Excel {#basic-data-analysis-with-excel}

Once we have [cleaned our data](#basic-data-cleaning-with-excel) we are ready
to start analyzing it. Our analysis can include viewing the data, summarizing
it in tables, and visualizing it in charts.

This chapter will demonstrate the use of Excel to construct ***univariate***
statistics and charts, i.e., statistics and charts that describe a single
variable. Later chapters will describe some ***multivariate*** methods
that can be used to describe the relationship between two or more variables.

## Viewing large data files

The first step in any data analysis is to literally look at the data. It is easy
to miss obvious problems or surprising patterns if you just dive right into
calculations.

::: example
**Historical employment data for Canada**

Our analysis in this chapter will use historical employment data for Canada from
January 1976 through January 2021.

1. Set up a project folder.
2. Download the file at
[https://bookdown.org/bkrauth/IS4E/sampledata/CanEmpHist.xlsx](sampledata/CanEmpHist.xlsx) and put it in your raw data subfolder.
3. Make a working copy in your project folder.
   - I called mine  `CanEmpHist-working.xlsx`.
4. Open your working copy. It will look something like this:  
![*Canadian employment data, 1976-2021*](bin/CanadaEmploymentHistorical.png)

There is a worksheet titled *Raw data* that contains the original data as
obtained from Statistics Canada, along with information on its sources.

Our main data set for analysis is in the worksheet *Data for Analysis*, which
includes the following variables:

- **MonthYr**: the month and year of the observation.
- **Population**: the civilian, non-institutionalized working-age population
  of Canada at that time, in thousands.
- **Employed**: the total number employed in the population, in thousands.
- **Unemployed**: the total number employed in the population, in thousands.
- **LabourForce**: the sum of Employed and Unemployed.
- **NotInLabourForce**: the difference between Population and LabourForce.
- **UnempRate**: the percentage of the labour force that is unemployed. As
  before, it is calculated and stored as a decimal (ranging from 0.0 to 1.0)
  but displayed as a percentage (ranging from 0% to 100%).
- **LFPRate**: the percentage of the population that is in the labour force. As
  before, it is calculated and stored as a decimal (ranging from 0.0 to 1.0)
  but displayed as a percentage (ranging from 0% to 100%).
- **Party**: the political party in control of the Federal government. If the 
  party in control changed during the month, it is listed as "Transfer".
- **PrimeMinister**: the name of the Prime Minister.  If the prime minister
  changed during the month, it is listed as "Transfer".
- **AnnPopGrowth**: the rate of population growth over the previous 12 months,
  calculated as a proportion and displayed as a percentage.  Note that this
  variable is blank for the first 12 months of the data set.

This data set covers over 500 months, and is much larger than the single month
of data we cleaned earlier.
:::

Most data sets of interest are very large.  For example, surveys from
Statistics Canada can have hundreds of variables and hundreds of thousands of
observations, and companies and governments often work with transactions-level
data that includes millions or even billions of observations. Humans are smart,
but not smart enough to fully understand a large data set without some kind of
simplification or "dimension reduction." Instead of trying to directly interpret
thousands or millions of numbers, we will need to calculate and view a
relatively small number of ***statistics*** based on the data.  A statistic is
just a number calculated from data.

But before we calculate statistics for our data set, we can use a few Excel
tools - sorting, filtering and freezing - to view selected parts of our
data set.

### Sorting

***Sorting*** allows us to re-order the rows of our data based on
the value in one or more of the columns.  Since order does not matter
with tidy data, we can sort in whatever way we like without changing
the content of our data.

::: {.fyi data-latex=""}
Before sorting data, always make sure that the order of rows does not convey
important information.
:::

::: example
**Sorting the employment data**

The original data are ordered by date. But suppose we wanted it to be ordered by
unemployment rate (with the highest rate on top) instead. Here's all we need to
do:

1. Select any cell in the **UnempRate** column.
2. Select `Home > Sort and Filter > Sort Largest to Smallest`.

As you can see, the data set is now sorted by unemployment rate. We can follow
similar steps to put the data set back in date order:

1. Select any cell in the **MonthYr** column.
2. Select `Home > Sort and Filter > Sort Oldest to Newest`.

Notice that Excel can tell whether a column contains numbers, texts or dates,
and will sort accordingly.
:::

You can sort in ascending or descending order, and you can sort on multiple
columns by selecting the "Custom sort" option.

### Filtering

***Filtering*** allows us to hide some observations so we can look at a
particular subset of observations that we are interested in. The hidden
observations are still there, so this is a much safer option than deleting
observations.

::: example
**Filtering the employment data**

Suppose we only want to see data from when Paul Martin was the Prime Minister.
Here's what we can do:

1. Select `Home > Sort and Filter > Filter`. If you look at the column headers
   in your sheet you will see that they have become drop-down boxes.
3. Click on the drop-down box for **PrimeMinister**, then uncheck every box
   but the one marked `Paul Martin`.

At this point, only the months when Paul Martin was the Prime Minister appear in
the table. Don't worry, the other ones haven't gone anywhere.

We can undo the filter and remove the drop-down boxes by selecting
`Home > Sort and Filter > Filter` again.
:::

You can filter on more complex criteria, and you can combine sorting and
filtering.

### Freezing panes

***Freezing panes*** keeps some rows and/or columns visible regardless of which
cell is currently selected.  This allows us to work with large tables while
keeping the top row (variable names) and/or the first column (observation IDs)
visible.

::: example
**Freezing panes**

Go down to row 50 or so in your worksheet. Notice that you cannot see the
variable names in row 1 any more.  We can make sure the first row stays
visible by doing the following:

1. Go back to cell A1.
2. Select `View > Freeze Panes > Freeze Top Row`.

Now go back down to row 50 or so. You will see that the top row is still
displayed and you can see the variable names.

To undo this, select `View > Freeze Panes > Unfreeze Panes`.
:::

Instead of freezing the first row, you can freeze the first column, or you can
freeze any number of rows and columns.

## Summary statistics

Next, we We will calculate some commonly-used ***univariate*** statistics, 
which are statistics that describe a single variable in isolation. In Section
\@ref(univariate-graphs-in-excel) we will construct some commonly-used
univariate graphs.

A table of ***summary statistics*** reports various univariate statistics for
each variable in our data set.  For example, our table of summary statistics
might look like this:

| Statistic       | *(variable name 1)* | *(variable name 2)* | *(etc.)* |
|:----------------|:-------------------:|---------------------|---------|
| Count           | *(count of valid observations)*
| Average         | *(average)*
| StdDev          | *(standard deviation)*
| Min             | *(minimum value observed)*  
| 10th percentile |
| Median          |
| 90th percentile |
| Max             | *(maximum value observed)*  

You saw many of these words - standard deviation, percentile, median, etc. - 
in Chapter \@ref(random-variables), but I need to be clear on something: even
though the names are the same, the concepts are *not* exactly the same.

We start by introducing some notation.  We can think of our data set 
$D_n = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ as a table of $n$ observations (rows),
numbered by some sequential index $i$.  The value of our variable of interest
in row $i$ is denoted by $x_i$; for example $x_1$ is the value of our variable
for the observation in the first row,  $x_{10}$ is the value in the tenth row,
etc.  We can then define various commonly-used statistics based on $D_n$:

The ***count*** or ***sample size*** is the number $n$ of observations with
valid (numeric) values for the variable.  It is calculated in Excel using the
`COUNT()` function.

The ***sample average*** is a measure of central tendency in data, and is
calculated:
\begin{align}
  \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i
\end{align}
or in Excel using the `AVERAGE()` function.

The ***sample standard deviation*** is a measure of variation in the data,
and is calculated:
\begin{align}
  \hat{sd}_x = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
\end{align}
or in Excel using the `STDEV.S()` function.

The ***sample minimum*** is the lowest value observed in the data, and the
***sample maximum*** is the highest value observed in the data.  They can be
calculated in Excel using the `MIN()` and `MAX()` functions.

The ***sample median*** is another measure of central tendency, and is (roughly)
a number that is above half of the observations and below the other half.
Its more precise definition is: 
\begin{align}
  \hat{m} &= \begin{cases}
    x_{[(n/2) + (1/2)]} & \textrm{if $n$ is odd} \\
    \frac{x_{[n/2]} + x_{[(n/2) + 1]}}{2} & \textrm{if $n$ is even} \\
    \end{cases}
\end{align}
where $x_{[k]}$ is the value of $x_i$ for the $k$th-lowest observation in the
data set. This formula looks complicated, but it's just a way of describing how
you were probably taught to calculate medians in grade school. For example:

  - The sample median of $D_3 = (4,1,3)$ is $\hat{m} = 3$.
  - The sample median of $D_4 = (4,1,3,2)$ is $\hat{m} = 2.5$.

It can be calculated in Excel using the `MEDIAN()` function.

The ***sample 10th percentile*** is (roughly) a number that is above 10\% of
observations in the data, and the ***sample 90th percentile*** is a number
that is above 90\% of observations. Either can be calculated in Excel using the `PERCENTILE.INC()`
function.  I will not give you a precise definition or ask you to calculate
sample percentiles by hand.

Note that the sample average/median/percentiles/etc. describe
*the values observed in a set of data*, and are calculated from that data set.
The mean/median/percentiles we learned about in  Chapter \@ref(random-variables)
describe  *the probability distribution of a random variable* and are calculated
from that probability distribution. As you might imagine, these two sets of
concepts are distinct but related.  We will discuss how they are related in
Chapter \@ref(statistics). For now, just keep in mind that they are distinct.

### Constructing the table

The first step in constructing a table of summary statistics is to 
create a new blank worksheet and fill in the structure of the table.

::: example
**Table setup**

To set up the table:

1. Create a new blank worksheet.
   - You can do this by clicking on the
     !["+"](bin/AddWorksheetButton.png){height=16pt} button at the bottom of the
     screen.
2. Rename the worksheet *Summary Statistics*.
   - You can do this by double-clicking on the tab for your new worksheet. A
     dialog box will open for you to enter the new name.
3. Fill in the first column (cells A1:A9) as in the table above.
:::

The next step is to fill in the row of variable names.  We could type them in,
but let's do something more sophisticated and flexible: use a formula to pull
the variable names in from the original data set.

::: example
**Getting variable names from the data**

To fill in the variable name for column B:

1. Go to cell B1. 
2. Type `=` but *don't* hit `<enter>` yet.
3. Use your mouse to select the tab for the *Data for Analysis* worksheet, and
   then select cell G1 in the *Data for Analysis* worksheet.
   - The formula bar now says `='Data for Analysis'!G1`
4. Select `<enter>`. 
   - You should now be back in cell B1 in the Summary statistics worksheet.
   - Cell B1 should display **UnempRate** (the contents of cell G1 in 
     *Data for Analysis*).

What have we done here? We have constructed a formula that successfully
references a cell in another worksheet. Note that the relative references are
even copied over correctly. 
:::

Excel has many built-in functions to calculate summary statistics.

::: example
**Summary statistics for UnempRate**

To fill in the statistics for column B:

1. Use the `COUNT()` function to report the observation count in cell B2.
   - We will want to use an absolute reference for the rows, and a relative
     reference for the columns, so the formula should be 
     `=COUNT('Data for Analysis'!G$2:G$542)`.
2. Use the `AVERAGE()` function to report the average unemployment rate in cell
   B3.
3. Use the `STDEV.S()` function to report the standard deviation of the
   unemployment rate in cell B4.
   - There is another built-in Excel function called `STDEV.P()` that uses a
     slightly different formula for the standard deviation:
     \begin{align}
       sd_x^p = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
     \end{align}
     We will discuss the difference between these two statistics later.
4. Use the `MIN()` function to report the minimum unemployment rate in cell B5.
5. Use the `PERCENTILE.INC()` function to report the 10th percentile of the
   unemployment rate in cell B6.
   - Warning: Despite its name, the `PERCENTILE.INC()` function takes a quantile
     (between 0 and 1) rather than a percentile (between 0 and 100) as its argument.
6. Use the `MEDIAN()` function to report the median unemployment rate in cell
   B7.
7. Use the `PERCENTILE.INC()` function to report the 90th percentile of the
   unemployment rate in cell B8.
8. Use the `MAX()` function to report the maximum unemployment rate in cell B9.

We now have a table that reports all of the major summary statistics calculated
for the unemployment rate. 
:::

We would also like to calculate summary statistics for other variables.
Fortunately, we have set up our table in a way that makes that easy.

::: example
**Summary statistics for other variables**

To fill in summary statistics for other variables:

1. Copy the contents of cells B1:B9 to cells C1:F9.

Now column C contains summary statistics for the labour force participation
rate (**LFPRate**), and columns D through F contain summary statistics for some
of the other variables in our data set.
:::

If we wanted to, we could set up the table to calculate summary statistics for
all of the variables.  But let's just stop with these, and move on to making the
table look a little nicer.

### Cleaning up the table

Our table now has all of the information we need, but it is still kind of ugly.
Let's make it look nice and presentable.

The first problem is that the columns may be too narrow or too wide. If a column
is too narrow, some of its values will display as "####". If it is too wide, it
will take up too much room.

::: example
**Cell size**

There are many different ways to adjust row heights and column widths, but here
is the simplest:

1. Select the whole sheet by clicking on the 
   ![select sheet](bin/SelectSheetButton.png){height=16pt} 
   button in its upper left corner.
2. Select `Home > Format > AutoFit Column Width` from the menu.

Not only will this make everything fit, it will automatically adjust the width
as necessary when anything changes.
:::

The second problem is that the non-numeric variables report error codes like 
`#DIV/0!` or `#NUM!` for several statistics, and nonsense values for others. 

::: example
**Error codes**

It is usually better to leave something blank than have it display meaningless,
confusing or incorrect information.  So let's just delete those columns:

1. Select columns D and E.
2. Select `Home > Delete > Delete Sheet Columns`.
:::

Finally, we might want to make the display formatting a little nicer.

::: example
**Display formatting** 

To make the display formatting a little nicer:

1. Put the top row in **bold**.
2. Put the first column in *italics*.
3. Adjust the number display formats to look nice. Remember that the number
   display format has no effect on the number itself.
   - Leave the counts as they are.
   - Display the unemployment rate, LFP rate and population growth rate in
     percentages, rounded to one decimal place.
4. We now have a nice table of summary statistics that we could put into a Word
   or PowerPoint document, and share with an audience:

   ![*Table of summary statistics*](bin/SummaryStatisticsTable.png)
   Feel free to play around with colors, fonts, etc. to improve upon this table.   
5. Once you have the table you like, save your working copy.

:::

## Frequency tables

Another way of describing a single variable is a ***frequency table***.  A
frequency table describes how often different values appear in the data.

### Simple frequency tables

A ***simple frequency table*** describes how many times each value
appears in the data.  Simple frequency tables are useful when the
underlying variable is discrete, categorical, or even non-numeric,
and they look like this:

| (variablename)   | Count        | Percentage   |
|:-----------------|:------------:|:------------:|
| *(value1)*       | *(# value1)* | *(% value1)* |
| *(value2)*       | *(# value2)* | *(% value2)* |
| *(value3)*       | *(# value3)* | *(% value3)* |
| *etc.*           |              |              |


where:

- The **(variablename)** column lists all possible values of the variable.
- The **Count** column reports the number of observations in which the 
  variable matches that value or range of values.
- The **Percentage** column reports the count as a percentage of the 
  total number of observations.

The Excel functions `COUNTIF()` and `COUNTIFS()` can be used to construct the
counts.  I will use `COUNTIFS()` which has a pair of arguments:

- The first argument `criteria_range` gives the range containing the data we
  want to describe. 
- The second argument `criteria` gives the criteria we want to match. 

The kind of criteria you can use are most easily described by examples:

- The formula `=COUNTIFS(A1:A5,"Hello")` returns a count of the number of cells
  in the range A1:A5 that contain the string "Hello".  
- The formula `=COUNTIFS(A1:A5,5)` returns a count of the number of cells that
  contain the number 5.
- The formula `=COUNTIFS(A1:A5,">0")` returns a count of the number of cells in
  the range A1:A5 that contain a number greater than zero.
- The formula `=COUNTIFS(A1:A5,B1)` returns a count of the number of cells in
  the range A1:A5 that satisfy the criterion given in cell B1.

::: example
**A simple frequency table**

Let's create a frequency table for the **Party** variable in our data set. It
should look like this:

| Party          | Count              | Percentage         |
|:---------------|:------------------:|:------------------:|
| *Liberal*      | *(# Liberal)*      | *(% Liberal)*      |
| *Conservative* | *(# Conservative)* | *(% Conservative)* |
| *NDP*          | *(# NDP)*          | *(% NDP)*          |
| *Transfer*     | *(# Transfer)*     | *(% Transfer)*     |

Note that I have included a political party (the NDP) that is not  observed in
our data set.  We start by setting up the table:

1. Create a new sheet named *Party control*.
2. Fill in the top row and first column as in the table above.

Next we will fill in values for the **Count** column (B):

3. Fill in cell B2 using the Excel function `COUNTIFS()`.
   - The `criteria_range` will be the data in our main data set 
     (the *Data for Analysis* worksheet) covering the **Party** variable 
     (cell range I2:I542), or `'Data for Analysis'!I2:I542`.
   - The `criteria` we want to match is the contents of the cell
     in the current row of column A, or `A2`.
   - So the formula to enter in cell B2 is
     `=COUNTIFS('Data for Analysis'!I2:I542,A2)`.
   - The result displayed should be 302, the number of observations in our data
     that have the Party identified as Liberal.
4. We will want to copy the formula in cell B2 to the other cells in column B.
   But before we do that, we need to make some of the relative references into
   absolute references.  In this case, our table will keep the same
   `criteria_range` but will want to change the `criteria`, so:
   - Change the formula in cell B2 to 
     `=COUNTIFS('Data for Analysis'!I$2:I$542,A2)`.
5. Copy cell B2 to cells B3:B4.
   - Check the formulas in those cells to make sure they look right.

Next, we need to fill in the **Percentage** column (C):

6. To do that we just need to divide each cell in the Count column by the sum of
   all the cells in that column. So the formula in cell C2 should be
   `=B2/SUM(B2:B5)`.
7. Change relative references to absolute references as needed.
8. Copy the formula in cell C2 to cells C3:C5.
9. By default, the percentages are displayed as proportions. Change the
   display format to percentage, with one decimal place.
10. Make any other formatting changes you like, and save your working copy.

We now have a simple frequency table for the Party variable:  
![*Party control frequency table*](bin/PartyControlFrequencyTable.png){width=50%}
:::

### Binned frequency tables

We can also construct frequency tables for continuous variables or discrete
variables with many possible values, but doing so is a little more complicated.
We cannot just construct a table with a row for each possible value, since there
are many possible values.

Instead, we divide the data's range of possible or observed values into a set of 
sub-ranges or ***bins***.  Then we can calculate and report the number or 
percentage of observations that fall within each bin.  A binned frequency table
looks like this:

| From      | To       | Count | Percentage |
|:----------|:--------:|:-----:|:----------:|
| *(from1)* | *(to1)*  |       |            |
| *(from2)* | *(to2)*  |       |            | 
| etc.      |          |       |            |

In constructing bins, we need to apply some good judgment, and keep in mind a
few requirements and considerations:

- We need the bins to cover the full range of the data.  In particular:
  - The lower bound of the lowest bin should be lower than the lowest value in
    the data. 
  - The upper bound of the highest bin should be higher than the highest value
    in the data.
  - Each bin's upper bound should be the lower bound of the next bin.
  - Boundaries should be addressed in a consistent manner, so that each
    observation falls into exactly one bin.
- We often want the bins to be equally sized. 
  - But that isn't always the case. See the unemployment rate table in the
    example below; if it used equally sized bins, most of the bins would be
    empty.
- We often want the upper and lower bounds of the bins to be nice round numbers.
- The number of bins is a matter for judgment, and depends on what kind of
  patterns we are aiming to find in the data:
  - We may miss broad patterns if we have too many bins.
  - We may miss potentially interesting details if we have too few bins.
  - The solution is to explore multiple options, and see what patterns you can
    find out.

Again, we will use `COUNTIFS()` to construct the counts. But we will need to
take advantage of a feature of `COUNTIFS()` I have not yet mentioned: it takes
multiple `criteria_range` and `criteria` arguments, allowing it to make multiple
comparisons (that's the difference between `COUNTIF()` and `COUNTIFS()`).

::: example
**A binned frequency table**

Let's create the following table for the unemployment rate variable: 

| From  | To     | Count | Percentage |
|:------|:------:|:-----:|:----------:|
|  0.0% |   5.0% |       |            |
|  5.0% |   7.5% |       |            |
|  7.5% |  10.0% |       |            |
| 10.0% |  15.0% |       |            |
| 15.0% | 100.0% |       |            |

where **Count** is the number of observations for **UnempRate** that are greater
than that row's *From* value and less than or equal to the row's *To* value, and
*Percentage* is the count as a percentage of the total.  We start by setting up
the table:

1. Create a new sheet titled *Unemployment frequency*.
2. Copy the first row and first two columns from the table above.
   - Enter the **From** and **To** values as decimals (0 to 1) and display 
     them as percentages (0% to 100%).
  
Next, we fill in counts in column C.  This will be a somewhat complex formula,
so we will build it in stages.

1. Let's start with cell C2.  We want this number to contain a count of all
   observations in which the value of **UnempRate** is between the value in
   cell A2 (0%) and the value in cell B2 (5%).
2. First, let's use the `COUNTIFS()` function to count the number of
   observations with **UnempRate** less than or equal to 5%.  The `COUNTIFS()`
   function takes two arguments:
   - The `criteria_range1` value should be the data range for the UnempRate
     variable, i.e, `'Data for Analysis'!G$2:G$542`. Note that I am using 
     absolute references here so that the formula will be copied correctly
     to other cells.
   - The `criteria1` value should be the string "<=0.05".
   - So the formula in cell C2 should be
     `=COUNTIFS('Data for Analysis'!G$2:G$542, "<=0.05")`
3. Next, let's modify the formula in cell C2 so that it only counts the
   observations with **UnempRate** less than or equal to 5% *and* greater than
   or equal to 0%.  We can do this by adding a second pair of arguments to
   our `COUNTIFS()` function. The formula is:  
     `=COUNTIFS('Data for Analysis'!G$2:G$542, "<= 0.05", 'Data for Analysis'!G$2:G$542, ">= 0.00")`.  If we give `COUNTIFS()` multiple criteria,
   it will count the number of cases that meet *all* of the criteria.
4. Next, let's modify the formula in cell C2 so that the literal numbers 0.00
   and 0.05 are replaced with the contents of cells A2 and B2 respectively.
   We can use the `CONCAT()` function to concatenate the text "<=" with
   the number in the relevant cell.  For example if cell B2 contains the number
   0.05, the formula `CONCAT("<= ",B2)` will return the text value `<= 0.05`.
   The revised formula in cell C2 should now be:
   `=COUNTIFS('Data for Analysis'!G$2:G$542, CONCAT("<= ",B2), 'Data for Analysis'!G$2:G$542, CONCAT(">= ",A2))`.
5. The formula in cell C2 does what we wanted, so let's copy it to cell C3.
   - The formula in cell C3 is `=COUNTIFS('Data for Analysis'!G$2:G$542, CONCAT("<= ",B3), 'Data for Analysis'!G$2:G$542, CONCAT(">= ",A3))`.
   - Unfortunately, there is a problem. If there are any observations with an
     unemployment rate *exactly* equal to 5%, it will be counted in cell C2 and 
     again in cell C3.
   - We can fix this issue by modifying the formula in cell C3 to 
     `=COUNTIFS('Data for Analysis'!G$2:G$542, CONCAT("<= ",B3), 'Data for Analysis'!G$2:G$542, CONCAT("> ",A3))`.  Note that we do not want to modify
     the formula in cell C2.
6. We can finish up by copying the formula in cell C3 to cells C4:C6. You can
   check your work by confirming that the total of cells C2:C6 adds up to the
   total number of observations (541).
7. Fill in the **Percentage** column (D) with the appropriate formula and change
   its display format to Percent.
8. Make any other formatting changes you like, and save your working copy.

We now have our binned frequency table:  
![*Binned frequency table for* **UnempRate**](bin/UnemploymentBinnedFrequencyTable.png){width=50%}

The `FREQUENCY()` function is another way to create a frequency table.  However,
this function is a tricky one to learn, and Microsoft recently changed how it
works.  So we will skip it.

## Univariate graphs in Excel 

Another way to explore our data is by ***visualizing*** it: constructing and
viewing graphs. In this section, we will construct and view three graphs that
are useful for understanding a single variable: the time series graph, the
bar/column graph, and the histogram. We will also discuss some basic principles
for producing presentation-quality graphs.

### Charts in Excel

Excel calls graphs ***charts***.  Excel charts have three main components:

1. The ***data source***.  This is the table containing the data used to
   construct the graph.
   - The individual columns in the data source are called ***series***.
2. The ***chart type***.  There are many chart types in Excel, but we will use
   just a few:
   - ***Line*** graphs have categories on the horizontal axis, and the value of
     a variable/series on the vertical axis.  Values are depicted by a line
     connecting the values of the series at each category.
   - ***Column*** charts have categories on the horizontal axis, and the value
     of a variable or series on the vertical axis.  Values are depicted by a
     vertical bar for each value of the series.
   - ***Bar*** charts are just column charts with the axes reversed.
   - ***Scatter*** or ***XY*** charts plot the value of one series against the
     value of another series.  Values can be depicted as a set of points, as a
     connected line, or both.
3. The ***chart elements***, which are the different pieces of the chart.
   - Chart elements can be added, removed, or modified.
   - The available elements vary across chart types, but can include axes,
     titles, legends, gridlines, and text labels.

The usual workflow here is to select the data, choose a chart type, and then
modify chart elements until the chart looks the way you want it.

### Time series (line) graphs

A ***time series graph*** plots one or more variables at multiple points in
time.  Conventionally, time is on the horizontal axis and the variable's value
is on the vertical axis. For example, we will generate a time series graph that
looks like this:  
![*Time series graph of* **UnempRate**](bin/TimeSeriesGraphFinal.png){width=50%}

In Excel, time series graphs can be implemented using either the Line chart type
or the Scatter chart type.  Line graphs are simpler, so we will start with that.
We will learn how to make scatter plots in Chapter \@ref(using-r).

The first step in creating an Excel chart is to select the data source and graph
type.

::: example
**Creating a time series graph for UnempRate**

We want to create a time series graph for our variable **UnempRate**.

1. Select any cell in the *Data for analysis* table.
2. Select `Insert > Recommended Charts` from the menu.
3. The dialog box will show a few recommended charts.  None of them are what
   we want, so select the `All Charts` tab at the top to see the full set
   of options.
4. Select `Line` to see the line graph options. 
5. The dialog box gives you several different types of line graph. Select the
   picture that looks like this:  
   ![Recommended](bin/RecommendedLineGraph.png){width=50%} 
   
   and select `OK`.

We have our time series graph (it looks like the picture above).  Unfortunately,
it has a line for *every* variable in our data source. We only want to plot
one variable, so let's get rid of the others:

1. Select `Chart Design > Select Data` which will open the `Select Data Source`
   dialog box.
2. Uncheck the check box next to every series in the "Legend Entries (Series)"
   box except **UnempRate**, and then select `OK`:  
![*Time graph series of* **UnempRate**](bin/TimeSeriesGraphInitial.png){width=50%}

This looks like the graph we want.
:::

### Creating presentation-quality graphs

The graph we have right now is perfectly fine for exploratory data analysis -
using graphs and other tools to better understand the data.  However, if we want
to convey our understanding to others we need to fine-tune the
***presentation*** of our data.  Like other elements of a presentation, graphs
should be clear, informative, concise, and professional in appearance.  

The field of ***data visualization*** was pioneered by the statistician Edward
Tufte and studies how best to visually convey information. A full discussion of
data visualization is beyond the scope of this course, but we can talk about and
apply a few basic ideas:

1. **Clarity**: Make all information provided clear to the reader.
2. **Completeness**: Provide all necessary information.
3. **Simplicity**: Remove all repeated, irrelevant or misleading elements
    (what Tufte calls "chartjunk").
4. **Closeness**: Minimize eye movement by keeping related information visually
   "close."
5. **Reinforce**: Use color and formatting to reinforce interpretation rather
   than to complicate it.
5. **Accessibility**: Take reader needs into account.  For example:
   - Color is not always available to readers: Some readers are color
     blind, projectors often get colors "wrong", or your document 
     may be printed on a black-and-white printer.
     - Always include non-color visual cues (for example, text labels) so that
       readers who cannot distinguish color (for whatever reason) can tell
       different series apart.
     - Consider using a color palette that is colorblind-friendly.
       - A simple way to do this is to avoid using red and green or blue and
         yellow as contrasting colors, since these are the two most common forms
         of colorblindness.
       - The geographer Cynthia Brewer has developed a set of
         colorblind-friendly palettes known as ColorBrewer.  They are available
         at https://colorbrewer2.org/. 
   - Readers in their 50's and above often have difficulty reading small text.
     - Avoid squeezing important text into a tight space.
     - Generate graphics that can be re-scaled.
   - Readers may have more general and severe visual impairments.
     - Provide alt text for all images.

::: example
**Preparing our graph for presentation**

Let's start by removing unnecessary chart elements.

1. Select the chart.  This will cause the `Chart Design` and `Format` menu items
   to appear in the menu.
2. To remove the horizontal gridlines, select 
   `Chart Design > Add Chart Element > Gridlines > Primary Major Horizontal`.
3. To remove the legend, select
   `Chart Design > Add Chart Element > Legend > None`.

Next, let's modify the title to be more informative.  Right now, it is not clear
from the graph what country's unemployment rate this is.

1. Select the title.
2. Type in the new title, and hit the `<enter>` key.
   - I went with the title **Canadian unemployment, 1976-present**
   - I also made it **boldface**.

Next, let's modify the horizontal axis to be a little less busy:

1. Double-click on the horizontal axis.  The `Format Axis` box should appear to
   the right.
   - It may take you more than one try to double-click on the correct object.
2. Select `Axis Options`.
   - You can see all of the choices Excel made here based on what it sees in the
     data. 
   - Feel free to play around with these options.  You can return each option to
     its original/default state by clicking on that option's `Reset` button.
3. Change the major units to either 4 Years or 8 Years, whichever one you like
   better.

Finally, let's add a text label for our time series:

1. Select the chart.
2. Select `Format > Insert Text Box` from the menu. The cursor will change into
   one that looks like this: 
3. Draw the text box at the desired location on the chart and enter the text
   "Unemployment rate"
4. Resize and move the box to just above the line for the time series.
5. Change the color of the text to the same color as the line.
   
This isn't really necessary, and violates our principle of avoiding repeated
information. But it is useful when we are graphing multiple time series in the
same chart, as it is more direct than a legend.

Finally, we want to add alt text for the visually impaired.  

1. Select the chart.
2. Select `Format > Alt Text`. The Alt Text dialog box will open to the right.
3. Enter the alt text in the box.
   - I used *Graph of Canadian unemployment rate from January 1976 to present.*
4. Make any other formatting changes you like, and save your working copy.

The graph will now look like the one above. The graph here is visually clean
and simple, in part because I left out many elements that I could have included: 
axis labels (not needed because the units are obvious from context), a fancy 
background, etc.
:::

One consideration that often comes up when constructing graphs is whether the
vertical axis should start at zero when the range of data does not reach zero.
In our time series graph of the unemployment rate, Excel included 0% by default
even though the variable never went below 5%. I could have changed the vertical
axis to start at 5%, but decided not to.

There is no strict rule for whether to include zero, but we can consider the
general principle described earlier: our graph should be informative and not
misleading. For example, setting the vertical axis to run from 0% to 100% (the
theoretical range for the unemployment rate) would be misleading because it
would flatten out the line graph and lead the reader to mistakenly conclude
that the unemployment rate does not vary much.

Data visualization skills are valuable in the academic world and in the
business world.  If you are interested in developing your skills
further, you might consider our course
ECON 334: *Data Visualization and Economic Analysis*.

You might also get a book on data visualization. Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic's
*Storytelling with Data* is aimed at a business audience and uses Excel.
Kieran Healy's *Data Visualization* is aimed at a primarily academic audience
and uses R. Both of them are practical and easy reads, with many examples.

### Frequency (bar/column) graphs

***Bar*** graphs are used to represent the frequency distribution of a
categorical variable.  Bar graphs use bars of different length to represent the
value of some aggregate variable in each category.

Bar graphs are produced from a frequency table, as they are a visual depiction
of the information in such a table.

They can be produced in Excel using either the Bar chart type or the Column
chart type.  The difference between the two is that the bars are horizontal in
the Bar chart type and vertical in the Column chart type.

::: example
**A bar graph of the Party variable**

To construct a bar graph of the **Party** variable:

1. Select any cell in the *Party control* worksheet.
2. Select `Insert > Recommended Charts` from the menu.
3. Select the `All Charts` tab to see the full list of options.
4. Select `Column` and then select `OK`.  

The graph will look something like this:  
![*Bar graph of* **Party** *variable, default options*](bin/BarGraphInitial.png){width=50%}

As you can see, basic bar graphs are quite simple.  There is a bar for each
category (the first column of the table) and variable (the other columns), and
the length of each bar corresponds to its value. 

As with our line graph, the current graph contains more information than we
actually want - it shows the count *and* the percentage (you can't see the
percentage bars because the percentage is a much smaller number than the 
count).  We really only need one of those.  We also may decide that the bars
for NDP and "Transfer" ar irrelevant. We can get rid of this irrelevant
information:

1. Select the chart.
2. Select `Chart Design > Select Data`.
3. Uncheck the check boxes for Percentage, NDP and Transfer.

We now have a bar graph that looks like this:  
![*Bar graph of* **Party** *variable, simplified*](bin/BarGraph2.png){width=50%}

and shows the number of months in which the two largest federal parties were in
government over the time frame of our data.
:::

As with line graphs, we can prepare a bar graph for presentation by using
Excel's tools with an eye towards the principles of effective presentation
graphics.

::: example
**Cleaning up our bar graph**

We can do a few easy things to simplify and clarify our bar graph:

1. Change the title.
2. Remove the gridlines.
3. Remove the legend.
4. Add the vertical axis title **Months in control** to clarify the units.

Another thing we can do is use color and branding to convey information: each
major Canadian political party has a distinctive color as part of its brand: red
for the Liberals, blue for the Conservatives, and orange for the NDP.

1. Double-click on the Liberal bar.
2. Change its color to red.
3. Double-click on the Conservative bar.
4. Change its color to blue.  The Conservatives use two shades of blue, so pick
   whichever one you like best.

Finally, the purpose of a bar graph is to enable the viewer to compare
magnitudes, which requires looking at the *top* of each bar.  But you may notice
that the category labels are at the *bottom* of each bar. Following the
principle that we don't want to make the reader's eye do any extra work, let's
put those labels on top.

1. Select the chart.
2. Select `Chart Design > Add Chart Element > Data Labels > More data label options`.  
   You will notice the numbers 302 and 233 (the heights of the two bars) appear
   above the bars, and the `Format Data Labels` box will appear to the right.
3. Select `Label options` from the dialog box.
4. Uncheck `Value` and check `Category Name`. The category names Liberal and
   Conservative will now appear above the respective bar.
5. Select `Chart Design > Add Chart Element > Axes > Primary Horizontal` to
   eliminate the category names from the bottom of each bar.
6. You might also consider changing the color of the two labels to match the
   color of the corresponding bar.
7. Make any other formatting changes you like, and save your working copy.

Our final graph looks like this:  
![*Bar graph of* **Party** *variable, final version*](bin/BarGraphFinal.png){width=50%}
:::

One of the keys to effective bar graph design is to keep the graph simple and
clean, and to avoid "chartjunk."

Bar graphs should *always* start at zero.  The size of the bar is meant
to visually represent the value of the variable it is depicting. Using any
origin other than zero can cause relative sizes to be misleading.

::: example
**Why bar graphs should always start at zero**

Suppose we start our **Party** bar graph at 200 rather than zero.  We will get
this:  
![*Bar graph for* **Party**, *starting at 200*](bin/BarGraphNonzeroOrigin.png){width=50%}
    
The relative size of these bars is very misleading. The bar for Liberal is three
times as big as the bar for Conservative, even though the number it represents
is only 29% higher.
:::

Pie graphs are an alternative way of depicting relative frequencies, and are
also available in Excel along with 3-dimensional variations on both pie and bar
graphs:  

| Graph type   | Example                                                             |
|:-------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Pie graph    | ![*Pie chart of* **Party** *variable*](bin/PieChart.png){width=30%} |
| 3D pie graph | ![3D pie chart of Party variable](bin/3DPieChart.png){width=30%}    |    
| 3D bar graph | ![3D bar chart of Party variable](bin/3DBarChart.png){width=30%}    |


However, most data visualization experts recommend against their use. Research
on how people process visual information usually find that they are *less*
informative in practice. People are much better at evaluating the relative size
of two lines or rectangles than they are at evaluating the relative size of two 
pie slices. They are also much better at assessing relative distances in two
dimensions than they are in three dimensions.

### Histograms

A ***histogram*** is just a frequency bar/column graph for a continuous
variable.  It is constructed by sorting the variable's values into some number
of equally-sized bins and then plotting a bar for each bin that represents
counts or percentages.

The histogram is a built-in chart type in Excel.

::: example
**Constructing a histogram for UnempRate**

To construct a histogram of the **UnempRate** variable:

1. Select column G in the *Data for Analysis* worksheet.
   - Notice that for the other charts we could just select any cell in this
     worksheet.  For some reason, this won't work with the histogram chart type.
2. Select `Insert > Recommended Charts" from the menu bar.
3. Select the `All Charts` tab to see the full set of options.
3. Select `Histogram` and then `OK`.

Our graph will appear:  
![*Histogram of* **UnempRate**, *with default options*](bin/HistogramInitial.png){width=50%}

:::

There are two main choices in histogram design:

- How many bins and how should they be determined?
- Should we depict frequencies as counts or percentages?

Excel allows us to customize the bins in various ways. Unfortunately, Excel
histograms depict frequencies as counts, and do not easily allow for them to be
displayed as percentages.  We will use R to generate those histograms.

::: example
**Changing the bins for a histogram**

By default, Excel has chosen 12 equally-sized bins, and each covers 0.73
percentage points.  This is a reasonable starting point, but we may find another
choice will produce a more informative histogram.

First, let's try varying the *number* of bins.

1. Select or double-click on the horizontal axis to open the "Format Axis" box.
2. Select `Axis Options`.
3. Select `Number of bins` and change the number from 12 to something else.
   - Try a large number like 100 to see what a lot of small bins looks like.
   - Try a small number like 5 to see what a few large bins look like.

Looking at these graphs, a relatively large number of bins is needed to 
accurately convey the distribution of the unemployment rate. But using a lot of
bins makes the horizontal axis very busy and difficult to read. One alternative
that will help is to fix the bin *size* at some nice round number like 
1% (0.01) or 0.5% (0.005).

1. Select or double-click on the horizontal axis to open the `Format Axis` box.
2. Select `Axis Options`.
3. Select `Bin width` and change the number to 0.01.

Now the bins are exactly one percentage point wide, which makes the horizontal
axis a little easier to read and interpret. 

It would also be nice to modify the start and end points so that instead of the
bins being 5.4-6.4%, 6.4-7.4%, etc. they were 5-6%, 6-7%, etc. Unfortunately,
that does not seem to be possible in Excel. We can work around that limitation
by creating a binned frequency table, and making a column/bar chart of that
table.
:::

Finally, as with other graphs we will want to add, delete and modify various
elements to bring this histogram closer to presentation quality.

::: example
**Enhancing the quality of our histogram**

To enhance the quality of this histogram:

1. Add/modify the title to 
   **Histogram of the Canadian unemployment rate, 1976-present**.
2. Add the horizontal axis title **Unemployment rate**.
3. Add the vertical axis title **# of months**.
4. Make any other formatting changes you like, and save your working copy.

Our final histogram will look like this:  
![*Histogram of* **UnempRate**, *final version*](bin/HistogramFinal.png){width=50%}

1. Check your work.
2. Update your master version.

## Chapter review {-#review-basic-data-analysis}

Statistical analysis does not need to be complex to be useful.  Simple
univariate statistics and graphs can tell us a great deal about the economy.

In this chapter, we learned how to calculate simple statistics in Excel, and
how to construct simple graphs. Calculating the statistics is typically the
easiest part of a statistical analysis - cleaning data and interpreting the
results is much more challenging.

Later in the course, we will [bring theory and data together](#statistics)
by interpreting the statistics calculated in this chapter as random variables.
We will also move beyond the univariate statistics and graphs described in
this chapter by developing tools for multivariate data analysis in both
Excel and R.

## Practice problems {-#problems-basic-data-analysis}

Answers can be found in the [appendix](#answers-basic-data-analysis).

**GOAL #1: Use Excel tools for viewing larger data tables**

1. Open a copy of the historical unemployment data file
   [CanEmpHist.xlsx](sampledata/CanEmpHist.xlsx).  Use sort and filter to show
   only those months with unemployment rates over 12.5\%, sorted in descending
   order by unemployment rate (i.e., highest unemployment rates at the top).

   | Carl  |  78 |
   
   Use a calculator or pencil and paper to calculate the following statistics:
   
   a. Sample size.

   Enter this table in Excel, and use Excel functions to to calculate the following 
   statistics:
   
   a. Sample size.
   b. Sample average age.
   c. Sample median of age.
   d. Sample 25th percentile of age.
   e. Sample variance of age.
   f. Sample standard deviation of age.

   Use Excel to construct a binned frequency table of age, with bin widths of 10 years.

**GOAL #5: Construct and interpret time series (line) graphs in Excel**

5. Consider the following table of data:

   | Year  | Al's age |

   | 2018  |  26      |
   | 2019  |  27      |
   | 2020  |  28      |
   | 2021  |  29      |

   Use Excel to construct a time series graph of Al's age.

**GOAL #6: Construct and interpret bar graphs and histograms in Excel**

6. Consider the following table of data:

   | Name  | Age |
   |:------|:---:|
   | Al    |  25 |
   | Betty |  32 |
   | Carl  |  78 |
   
   Use Excel to construct a histogram of age, with bin widths of 10 years.
