# About this book {-}

As its name suggests, *Introductory Statistics for Economics* is a textbook
intended for use in an introductory (first or second year) statistics
course for economics majors.  It was written for use as a textbook for
ECON 233, the introductory statistics course for economics majors at Simon
Fraser University.

The content is similar to most other introductory statistics courses for
business and economics students, but with a few important differences. When
I was assigned to teach ECON 233 I reviewed the available textbooks and
found that most of them provide a somewhat dated perspective on statistical
analysis at an extremely high price. I wanted a textbook that was
fairly priced, combined both Excel and R, and reflected (or at least did
not run counter to) contemporary thinking about issues like reproducibility,
tidy data, and credible inference. The only way to get all of these
features was to write my own book.

The book is available at no charge (MIT License) in HTML, PDF, and EPUB formats
from https://bookdown.org/bkrauth/BOOK/. Instructors are welcome to assign
it as a course textbook, but are strongly encouraged to contact me first
as the book contents may change without warning.

The book itself has been created using [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/). Its
source code is (or will be) available at https://github.com/bvkrauth/econ233,
and errors or typos can be reported to me at <bkrauth@sfu.ca> or https://github.com/bvkrauth/econ233/issues.
