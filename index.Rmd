# About this book {-}

As its name suggests, *Introductory Statistics for Economics* is a textbook
intended for use in an introductory (first or second year) statistics
course for economics majors.  It was written for use as a textbook for
ECON 233, the introductory statistics course for economics majors at Simon
Fraser University.

The content is similar to most other introductory statistics courses for
business and economics students, but with a few important differences. When
I was assigned to teach ECON 233, I reviewed the available textbooks and
found that most of them provide a somewhat dated perspective on statistical
analysis at an extremely high price. I wanted a textbook that was
fairly priced, combined both Excel and R, and reflected (or at least did
not run counter to) contemporary thinking about issues like reproducibility,
tidy data, and credible inference. The only way to get all of these
features was to write my own book.

The book is available at no charge in HTML, PDF, and EPUB formats
at https://bookdown.org/bkrauth/IS4E/. Usage is allowed under the
[MIT License](https://github.com/bvkrauth/is4e/blob/master/LICENSE).
Instructors are welcome to assign it as a course textbook, but are
strongly encouraged to contact me first so that I can inform you
about any significant changes to the content.

The book itself has been created using [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/). Its
source code is available at https://github.com/bvkrauth/econ233, and errors or
typos can be reported to me at <bkrauth@sfu.ca> or

## Conventions of this book {-}

This book uses consistent visual conventions to convey information.

### Organization {-}

Each chapter is meant to be covered in one full week of a typical
one-semester course. Chapters are introduced with learning goals
and prerequisites to review before proceeding. Practice problems
are provided at the end of each chapter, and are organized by
learning goal.

The chapters themselves are organized into three parts.

- Chapters 1-5 (**FUNDAMENTALS**) introduce the basic theoretical concepts
  of probability and random variables, as well as the basic computer
  skills to work with data in Excel.
  - They assume basic computer skills as well as familiarity with
    sets, functions, and the summation operator.
  - They should be considered prerequisites for the later chapters.
  - Chapter 5 depends on Chapter 2, and Chapter 4 depends on Chapter 3.
    Otherwise, these chapters can be read or covered in any order.
- Chapters 6-8 (**STATISTICAL THEORY**) develop the theory of statistics.
  - They assume knowledge of the material from Chapters 1-5, especially Chapters
    3 and 4.
  - They are not required for Chapters 9-11.
  - They must be covered in order.
- Chapters 9-11 (**WORKING WITH DATA**) teach more advanced data skills
  in both Excel and R.
  - They chapters assume knowledge of the material from Chapters 1-5, 
    especially Chapters 2 and 5), but do not assume Chapters 6-8.
  - Chapter 11 depends on Chapter 10. Otherwise, they can be read or covered
    in any order.

There is also an appendix reviewing mathematical tools that are used
throughout the book, but that should have been covered in a previous
mathematics course.

### Typography {-}

`Computer instructions` including Excel formulas, R code,
file names, etc. are shown in code format.

$Mathematical$ expressions are shown in large italics.

*Excel worksheet names* are shown in italics. Italics are
also used to *emphasize* important points.

***New terminology*** is shown in bold and italics when introduced.

**Variable names** are shown in bold.

### Boxes {-}
